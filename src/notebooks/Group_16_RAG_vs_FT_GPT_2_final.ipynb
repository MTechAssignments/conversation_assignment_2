The decrease as a percent of Total revenues was due to the following factors: \\n\\u0095\\nCost of products sold increased $490 million but decreased 170 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold decreased $22 million or 130 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $438 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $429 million for the \\nprior year comparable period\\n; and\\n\\u0095\\nTotal operating expenses increased $830 million due to an increase in Selling, general, and administrative (\\u0093SG&A\\u0094) expense of $651 million driven by increased costs associated with both the one-time stand-up and recurring operations of a standalone company and commercial and marketing investments and an increase in R&D investments of $179 million. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 210 basis points and R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 60 basis points.\\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,568 million and 8.0%, a decrease of $348 million and 240 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:\\n\\u0095\\nOperating income decreased $87 million, as discussed above;\\n\\u0095\\nInterest and other financial charges \\u0096 net increased $465 million primarily due to interest expense related to the debt securities issued by GE HealthCare in November of 2022 and the Term Loan Facility drawn upon in January of 2023;\\n\\u0095\\nNon-operating benefit income increased $377 million primarily related to the pension plans transferred to GE HealthCare as part of the Spin-Off; and\\n\\u0095\\nProvision for income taxes increased $180 million primarily due to t\\nhe tax effect of foreign currency movement, the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement, including the effect of completing the 2022 U.S. federal tax return\\n, taxes accrued for the future repatriation of current earnings with a one-time charge for prior period earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to standalone GE HealthCare tax rates.

We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or related to our core operating results and the overall health of our company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to see our results \\u0093through the eyes of management.\\u0094 We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for making financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are often used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\\nThe non-GAAP financial measures we report include:\\nOrganic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate\\nWe believe that Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate, by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency rate fluctuations, provide management and investors with additional understanding and visibility into the underlying revenue trends of our established, ongoing operations. Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate also provide greater insight regarding the overall demand for our products and services.\\nAdjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin\\nWe believe Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin provide management and investors with additional understanding of our business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors. These metrics exclude interest expense, interest income, non-operating benefit (income) costs, and tax expense, as well as non-recurring and/or non-cash items, which may have a material impact on our results. In addition, we may from time to time consider excluding other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods. We believe this provides additional insight into how our businesses are performing, on a normalized basis. However, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.\\nAdjusted net income\\nWe believe Adjusted net income provides investors with improved comparability of underlying operating results and a further understanding and additional transparency regarding how we evaluate our business. Adjusted net income also provides management and investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain significant items on our earnings. Adjusted net income excludes non-operating benefit (income) costs, certain tax expense adjustments, and non-recurring and/or non-cash items, which may have a material impact on our results. In addition, we may from time to time consider excluding other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods. However, Adjusted net income should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.\\nAdjusted earnings per share\\nWe believe Adjusted earnings per share provides investors with improved comparability of underlying operating results and a further understanding and additional transparency regarding how we evaluate our business. Adjusted earnings per share also provides management and investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain significant items on our per share earnings. Adjusted earnings per share excludes non-operating benefit (income) costs, certain tax expense adjustments, and non-recurring and/or non-cash items, which may have a material impact on our results. In addition, we may from time to time consider excluding other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods. However, Adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.\\nAdjusted tax expense and Adjusted effective tax rate\\nWe believe that Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted effective tax rate provide investors with a better understanding of the normalized tax rate applicable to our business and provide more consistent comparability across periods. A\\ndjusted tax expense excludes the income tax related to the pre-tax income adjustments included as part of Adjusted net income and certain income tax adjustments, such as adjustments to deferred tax assets or liabilities. In addition, we may from time to time consider excluding other nonrecurring tax items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted effective tax rate is Adjusted tax expense divided by Income before income taxes less pre-tax income adjustments detailed above in Adjusted net income. However, Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted effective tax rate should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.\\n54\\nFree cash flow\\nWe believe that Free cash flow provides management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis. Free cash flow also provides insight into our flexibility to allocate capital, including reinvesting in the Company for \\nfuture growth, paying down debt, paying dividends, and pursuing other opportunities that may enhance stockholder value. Free cash flow is Cash from (used for) operating activities \\u0096 continuing operations including cash flows related to the additions and dispositions of PP&E and internal-use software as well as the impact of discontinued factoring programs. Interest \\nexpense associated with external debt that was historically held by GE is not recognized in the combined financial statements and related notes. Additionally, Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measures do not deduct the payments required for debt repayments.\\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\\nManagement recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from company to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations discussed below, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations below and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. The reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are provided below.\\nOrganic Revenue*\\nFor the years ended December

Additionally, we have access to revolving credit facilities of $3,500 million in aggregate, described in detail in Note 9, \\u0093Borrowings\\u0094 \\nto the consolidated and combined financial statements. Historically, we relied on cash pooling arrangements with GE to manage liquidity and fund our operations. U\\npon completion of the Spin-Off, we ceased participation in GE cash pooling arrangements and our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held and used solely for our own ongoing operations and commitments.\\nWe believe that our existing balance of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, future cash generated from operating activities, access to capital markets, and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our current and ongoing operations, pay taxes due, service our existing debt, and fund investments in our business for at least the next 12 months.\\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\\nCash Flow\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash from (used for) operating activities \\u0096 continuing operations\\n$\\n2,101\\n$\\n2,134\\nCash from (used for) investing activities \\u0096 continuing operations\\n(558)\\n(398)\\nCash from (used for) financing activities \\u0096 continuing operations\\n(478)\\n(822)\\nFree cash flow*\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n1,715\\n1,828\\nOperating Activities\\nCash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2,101 million and included Net income from continuing operations of $1,618 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $610 million, and a $127 million outflow from changes in assets and liabilities, primarily driven by company-funded benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and an increase in receivables, partially offset by lower cash taxes paid and a decrease in inventories.\\nCash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2,134 million and included Net income from continuing operations of $1,949 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $633 million, and a $448 million outflow from changes in assets and liabilities, primarily driven by an increase in inventory, higher cash taxes paid, and an increase in receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.\\nInvesting Activities\\nCash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $558 million and primarily included additions to PP&E of $387 million related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansion, new product introductions, and purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $147\\u00a0million primarily related to Caption Health, Inc. (\\u0093Caption Health\\u0094). On February 17, 2023, we acquired Caption Health, an AI company whose technology expands access to AI-guided ultrasound screening for novice users.\\nCash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $398 million and primarily included additions to PP&E of $310 million related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansion, and new product introductions. \\nFinancing Activities\\nCash used for financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $478 million and primarily included $1,317 million of transfers to GE, $850\\u00a0million partial repayment of our outstanding Term Loan Facility, and $211\\u00a0million of redemption of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $2,000\\u00a0million drawdown of the Term Loan Facility.\\nCash used for financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $822 million and primarily included $8,934 million of transfers to GE, partially offset by $8,198\\u00a0million of newly issued debt.\\nFree cash flow*\\nFree cash flow* was $1,715 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and primarily included $2,101 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $387 million of cash used for additions to PP&E.\\nFree cash flow* was $1,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and primarily included $2,134 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $310 million of cash used for additions to PP&E.\\n____________________\\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\\n58\\nCapital Expenditures\\nCash used for capital expenditures was $387 million and $310 million for the \\nyears ended\\n December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing capacity expansion, and equipment and tooling for new and existing products including new product introductions.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under lease, debt, and purchase arrangements are provided in Note 7, \\u0093Leases,\\u0094 Note 9, \\u0093Borrowings,\\u0094 and Note 14, \\u0093Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies,\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have material cash requirements related to our pension obligations as described in Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans,\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nDebt and Credit Facilities\\nAs part of our capital structure, we have incurred debt. The servicing of this debt will be supported by cash flows from our operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had $9,442\\u00a0million of total debt compared to $8,249\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in debt was mainly driven by drawdown of the Term Loan Facility by \\n$2,000\\u00a0million\\n in connection with our Spin-Off in January 2023, partially offset by \\n$850\\u00a0million\\n repayment of the outstanding Term Loan Facility in December 2023.\\nThe weighted average interest rate for the Notes and our Credit Facilities for the \\nyear ended\\n December 31, 2023 was \\n6.03%. \\nWe had no principal debt repayments on the Notes for the \\nyear ended\\n December 31, 2023.\\nIn addition to the Term Loan Facility, our credit facilities include a five-year senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $2,500\\u00a0million expiring in January 2028, and a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $1,000\\u00a0million expiring in December 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings on either of the two revolving facilities.\\nThe Credit Facilities include various customary covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens securing debt, the entry into certain fundamental change transactions by GE HealthCare, and the maximum permitted leverage ratio. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023\\n, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements, including the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. \\nFor additional details on debt and credit facilities, see \\nNote 9\\n, \\n\\u0093Borrowings\\u0094\\n to the consolidated and combined financial statements.\\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\\nWe have historically relied, via GE, on the debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our operations. Concurrent with our Spin-Off, we accessed the capital markets and raised $10,250 million of debt by issuing \\n$8,250\\u00a0million\\n of senior unsecured notes in November 2022, and completed a drawdown of the Term Loan Facility of \\n$2,000\\u00a0million\\n in January 2023. In addition, we were able to arrange revolving credit facilities of $3,500 million to further support our liquidity needs. We plan to continue to rely on capital markets, and we expect to have access to credit facilities to fund our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing will be influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions. Moody\\n\\u0092\\ns Investors Service (\\n\\u0093\\nMoody\\n\\u0092\\ns\\n\\u0094\\n), Standard and Poor\\u0092s Global Ratings (\\n\\u0093\\nS&P\\n\\u0094\\n), and Fitch Ratings (\\n\\u0093\\nFitch\\n\\u0094\\n) currently issue ratings on our long-term debt. Our credit ratings as of January 30, 2024 are set forth in the table below. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Fitch affirmed our long term rating, and Moody\\u0092s issued their credit opinion consistent with our ratings listed below. \\nMoody\\u0092s\\nS&P\\nFitch\\nLong-term rating\\nBaa2\\nBBB\\nBBB\\nOutlook\\nStable\\nStable\\nStable\\nWe are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity.

We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\\n59\\nTo prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our consolidated and combined financial statements, and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management\\u0092s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Business Combination Related Measurements, Pensions, and Income Taxes. \\nSee Note 2, \\u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our significant accounting policies.\\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\\nOur revenues are recorded based on the consideration specified in customer contracts net of any sales incentives, discounts, returns, chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees, rebates, or credits, which are accounted for as estimated variable consideration. Our estimates for these deductions are based upon historical experience and consider current and forecasted market trends. We record the estimated amounts as a reduction to revenue when we recognize the related product or service sale. \\nChargebacks are a form of variable consideration that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the contracted customer. A provision for outstanding chargebacks is recorded at the time we recognize revenue from the sale to the wholesaler and requires certain estimates such as the wholesaler chargeback rates, the expected sell-through levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. \\nThe amounts of variable consideration included in the net transaction price for revenue recognition are limited to the amounts that are estimated to be probable of occurrence to avoid a material revenue reversal in a future period. \\nSee Note 3, \\u0093Revenue Recognition\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on revenue recognition.\\nBUSINESS COMBINATION RELATED MEASUREMENTS. \\nOur consolidated and combined financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the combination. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration we may be liable to pay in the future, are recorded on the date of the business combination at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Our business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense. The fair values of acquired intangible assets and liabilities are determined using information available at the business combination date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable. Significant assumptions vary by the class of asset or liability and the valuation technique used and can include the discount rates, timing, and probability of achieving regulatory and commercialization milestones and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; growth rates; royalty rates; and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage third-party valuation specialists who review our critical assumptions and prepare the calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant business combinations. \\nSee Note 8, \\u0093Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our business combinations.\\nPENSIONS.\\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and related asset and liability measurement. The Company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. The Company periodically evaluates other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and updates them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. \\nProjected benefit obligations (\\u0093PBO\\u0094) are measured as the present value of expected payments. We discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the expected timing of benefit payment. Generally, lower discount rates increase present values and increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and decrease subsequent-year pension expense. \\n60\\nA 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2024 and PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (\\u0093APBO\\u0094) as of December 31, 2023:\\nDiscount Rate Sensitivity\\nPrincipal Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Plans\\n50 bps increase in discount rate\\nImpact on PBO/APBO at December 31, 2023\\n$\\n(859)\\n$\\n(296)\\n$\\n(37)\\nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2024\\n37\\u00a0\\n6\\u00a0\\n3\\u00a0\\n50 bps decrease in discount rate\\nImpact on PBO/APBO at December 31, 2023\\n$\\n940\\u00a0\\n$\\n318\\u00a0\\n$\\n40\\u00a0\\nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2024\\n(42)\\n(7)\\n(3)\\nThe deficit sensitivity to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan\\u0092s asset allocation.\\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans\\u0092 assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields, and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also consider expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. A 1% change in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the 2024 net periodic benefit costs of these plans by $207 million.\\nOur pension plan assets contain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. While the majority of these assets are valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets, the fair value of certain assets is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These assets primarily relate to real estate and private equity investments.\\nFor pension benefits and retiree health and life benefits transferred from GE on January 1, 2023, third-party actuaries were engaged to assist in the valuation of transferred pension assets and liabilities using assumptions provided by GE which the Company reviewed prior to recording amounts in our combined financial statements. \\nSee Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our postretirement benefit plans. \\nINCOME TAXES.\\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, GE HealthCare is included in the combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns of GE, where eligible. However, we have adopted the separate return approach for purposes of our combined financial statements. The income tax provisions and related deferred tax assets and liabilities reflected in our combined financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been estimated as if we were a separate taxpayer. \\nOur annual tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax incentives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly impact the estimate of our tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates; we use our historical experience as well as our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.\\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the settlement or effective settlement of positions with the relevant taxing authorities. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these changes; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Such differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\\n61\\nSee Note 11, \\u0093Income Taxes\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on income taxes.\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices, which may impact future income, cash flows, and fair value of our business. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations, or the fair value interest rate risk of our financial instruments bearing fixed interest by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such risks. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative contracts to the extent they meet the objectives described above, and not for speculative purposes. \\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.\\nAs a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses, including those arising from intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign operations creating exposure to foreign currency translation risk. Such principal currencies include the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen, the Norwegian Krone, and the British Pound Sterling, among others. Operating entities with functional currencies other than the USD also create exposure to foreign currency risk realized upon their sale or a complete or substantially complete liquidation.\\nWe use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including hedging of significant currency exposures. We use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts and economic hedges when we have exposures to currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting. We use net investment hedging to hedge the foreign currency risk of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates against the USD. As a result of the above mitigating activities, we have been able to significantly reduce the financial impact of volatility from currency fluctuations.\\nThe potential decrease in fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts from a 10% decrease in USD spot rates against other applicable currencies would have been $13 million as of December 31, 2023. This excludes foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges as changes in the fair value of those contracts are not expected to impact earnings. The sensitivity analysis assumes a uniform weakening of USD spot rates against the other applicable currencies, compared to the actual exchange rates applied as of December 31, 2023, with all other factors remaining constant. This sensitivity analysis disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged currency exposures in earnings.\\nThe effect arising from foreign currency transactions, including the remeasurement of derivatives mentioned above, can result in significant fluctuations at points in time, but generally will be offset as the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. The global nature of our customer base and manufacturing footprint allows for the natural offset of certain income and costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Note 2, \\u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\u0094 for net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK.\\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in benchmark interest rates, related to the fair value of our borrowings bearing fixed interest rates and variability of cash flows related to our investments and borrowings bearing variable interest rates.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have $8,250\\u00a0million of fixed-rate debt and $1,150\\u00a0million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility which carries a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2023, we have $2,504 million of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, which are invested in short-term investments that generate income based on variable interest rates.\\nA change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and would impact our earnings and cash flows associated with our floating-rate debt. A hypothetical change of interest rates by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $22\\u00a0million, partially offset by the change in interest income from our cash investments.\\nWe primarily manage interest rate risk by using a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt that we deem appropriate. We entered into interest-rate swap contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023, to synthetically convert $1,000\\u00a0million of our senior unsecured notes from fixed rates to variable rates as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.\\n62\\nCOMMODITY RISK.\\nWe rely upon supplies of certain raw materials including helium, iodine, and rare earth minerals. Worldwide demand, availability, and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future. If supply of these materials is restricted or if prices increase, this could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers, and patients who may rely on our products.\\nSimilarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility. If the costs of certain commodities or of energy, shipping, or transportation increase and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nDisruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities (including as a result of war, natural disasters, climate change-related physical and transitional risks, actual or threatened public health emergencies, or other business continuity events) adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. \\nWe may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from commodity price fluctuations. The impact of commodity hedges is recognized in earnings in the applicable current period.\\nEQUITY RISK.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have $269\\u00a0million of deferred compensation liabilities subject to the risk of changes in equity prices. A change in the U.S equity markets would result in a corresponding change in the fair value of these deferred compensation liabilities, which would impact our earnings and cash flows. We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from equity price fluctuations.\\nSee Note 13, \\u0093Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\u0094 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\\n63\\nITEM 8.

(the \\u0093Company\\u0094) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated and combined statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\u0093financial statements\\u0094). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013)\\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 6, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u0092s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u0092s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter \\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nIncome Taxes \\u0096 Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets\\n \\u0097 Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\\nCritical Audit Matter Description\\nThe Company recognizes deferred income taxes for tax attributes and for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies.\\nThe Company\\u0092s determination of the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets involves judgments and estimates, including the projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income. Auditing management\\u0092s projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income, which affect the recorded valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.\\n65\\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\\nWith the assistance of our income tax specialists, our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize certain net deferred tax assets included the following, among others: \\n\\u0095\\nWe considered relevant tax laws and regulations in evaluating the appropriateness of management\\u0092s estimates of future sources of taxable income.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\\u0092s estimates of future sources of taxable income by comparing the estimates to historical sources of taxable income or loss.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated management\\u0092s projected timing and projected pattern of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated whether the estimated future sources of taxable income were of the appropriate character to utilize the deferred tax assets under tax law.\\n/s/ \\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\\nChicago, Illinois\\nFebruary 6, 2024\\nWe have served as the Company\\u0092s auditor since 2022. \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the \\u0093Company\\u0094) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013)\\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013)\\n issued by COSO.\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 6, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\\nBasis for Opinion \\nThe Company\\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\u0092s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n66\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ \\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\\nChicago, Illinois\\nFebruary 6, 2024\\n67\\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Income\\nFor the years ended

As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax curtailment loss of approximately $\\n17\\n\\u00a0million as non-operating benefit costs and an increase to our pension liability of $\\n23\\n\\u00a0million. As a result of the plan changes, we remeasured the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. These changes collectively decreased AOCI by $\\n305\\n\\u00a0million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, management approved and paid a one-time lump sum payment for certain terminated employees in \\ntwo\\n plans who were vested in their benefits. These lump sum settlements reduce our future cash requirements and premiums. As a result of the partial settlement of the pension liability, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge. The settlement charge of $\\n61\\n\\u00a0million represents a pro rata portion of unrecognized net loss recorded in AOCI and is recorded in Non-operating benefit (income) costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n94\\nPre-tax Cost of Postretirement Benefit Plans and Changes in Other Comprehensive Income\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nPrincipal Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nCost of postretirement benefit plans\\n$\\n(\\n290\\n)\\n$\\n44\\n$\\n(\\n86\\n)\\n$\\n9\\n$\\n23\\nChanges in other comprehensive loss (income):\\nTransfers from GE at Spin-Off\\n(\\n1,989\\n)\\n740\\n(\\n1,216\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nPlan amendments\\n53\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nNet loss (gain) \\u0096 current year\\n606\\n287\\n50\\n(\\n74\\n)\\n(\\n86\\n)\\nReclassifications out of AOCI:\\nCurtailment / settlement gain (loss)\\n(\\n47\\n)\\n(\\n61\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nAmortization of net loss (gain)\\n125\\n(\\n10\\n)\\n64\\n(\\n5\\n)\\n(\\n16\\n)\\nAmortization of prior service credit\\n(\\n4\\n)\\n3\\n87\\n5\\n4\\nTotal changes in other comprehensive loss (income)\\n$\\n(\\n1,256\\n)\\n$\\n959\\n$\\n(\\n1,015\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n74\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n98\\n)\\nCost (income) of postretirement benefit plans and changes in other comprehensive loss (income)\\n$\\n(\\n1,546\\n)\\n$\\n1,003\\n$\\n(\\n1,101\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n65\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n75\\n)\\nAssumptions\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nPrincipal Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nWeighted-average benefit obligations assumptions\\nDiscount rate\\n5.2\\n%\\n4.5\\n%\\n5.1\\n%\\n4.3\\n%\\n1.9\\n%\\nCompensation increases\\n3.9\\n%\\n3.1\\n%\\n3.6\\n%\\n3.0\\n%\\n2.8\\n%\\nWeighted-average benefit cost assumptions\\nDiscount rate\\n5.5\\n%\\n4.9\\n%\\n5.4\\n%\\n1.9\\n%\\n1.4\\n%\\nExpected rate of return on plan assets\\n7.0\\n%\\n5.6\\n%\\n\\u0097\\n%\\n6.3\\n%\\n5.4\\n%\\nFor the December 31, 2023 postretirement health care obligations remeasurement, the Company assumed a \\n6.5\\n% initial weighted average rate of increase in the per capita cost of the various covered health care benefits, which applies primarily to non-Medicare eligible participants. The trend rate was assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of \\n5.0\\n% in 2029 and remain at that level thereafter.\\nAssumptions Used in Calculations \\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement, and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in today\\u0092s U.S. dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments are expected to be made. We also assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.\\nGE HealthCare engages third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of the pension and other postretirement plan assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions, such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and update them as necessary to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future.\\nWe determine the discount rate using the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities that have maturities consistent with the expected timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations and generally increase pension expense in the following year; higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.\\n95\\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future.\\nThe compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which compensation of active plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Financial Position and amortized to earnings in subsequent periods. \\nWith respect to the pension balances included on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023, we estimate that we will amortize $(\\n116\\n)\\u00a0million of net actuarial gain and $(\\n81\\n)\\u00a0million of prior service credit from AOCI into Non-operating benefit (income) cost in the Consolidated Statement of Income during 2024. \\nExpected Future Benefit Payments of Our Benefit Plans\\nPrincipal Pension Plans\\nOther Pension Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\n2024\\n$\\n1,277\\n$\\n226\\n$\\n130\\n2025\\n1,289\\n239\\n124\\n2026\\n1,300\\n239\\n119\\n2027\\n1,307\\n243\\n114\\n2028\\n1,310\\n254\\n110\\n2029-2033\\n6,449\\n1,334\\n454\\nPENSION PLAN ASSETS.\\nThe GE HealthCare Employee Benefits Investment Committee (the \\u0093Investment Committee\\u0094) oversees and monitors the investment of the assets of our U.S. funded pension plans.

In assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023, we considered all available evidence, including the nature of financial statement losses, reversing taxable temporary differences, estimated future operating profits, and tax planning actions and strategies.\\nDeferred Income Taxes\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTotal assets\\n$\\n4,474\\n$\\n1,550\\nTotal liabilities\\n(\\n68\\n)\\n(\\n370\\n)\\nNet deferred income tax asset (liability)\\n$\\n4,406\\n$\\n1,180\\n99\\nComponents of the Net Deferred Income Tax Asset (Liability)\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nEmployee benefits\\n$\\n1,418\\n$\\n222\\nContract liabilities\\n171\\n193\\nInventories\\n95\\n84\\nOperating loss carryforwards\\n648\\n176\\nOther accrued expenses\\n68\\n70\\nReceivables\\n45\\n42\\nLease liabilities\\n75\\n57\\nTax credit carryforwards\\n59\\n128\\nContract assets\\n79\\n99\\nU.S. interest restriction carryforwards\\n61\\n\\u0097\\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\\n1,461\\n\\u0097\\nProperty, plant, and equipment\\n261\\n338\\nCapitalized R&D\\n547\\n554\\nOther\\n8\\n\\u0097\\nTotal deferred income tax asset\\n4,996\\n1,963\\nValuation allowances\\n(\\n540\\n)\\n(\\n272\\n)\\nTotal deferred income tax asset after valuation allowance\\n4,456\\n1,691\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n458\\n)\\nROU assets\\n(\\n50\\n)\\n(\\n47\\n)\\nOther\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n6\\n)\\nTotal deferred income tax liability\\n(\\n50\\n)\\n(\\n511\\n)\\nNet deferred income tax asset (liability)\\n$\\n4,406\\n$\\n1,180\\nEffective January 1, 2022, U.S. taxpayers are required to capitalize certain R&D expenses and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This provision increased our taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and resulted in additional cash payments for U.S. federal and state income taxes. A deferred tax asset on 2023 R&D expenses was recorded related to this provision with a balance of $\\n267\\n\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2023. A deferred tax asset on 2022 R&D expenses was recorded related to this provision with a balance of $\\n197\\n\\u00a0million and $\\n293\\n\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the event the capitalization of research costs is adjusted through retroactive legislation effective for 2022, the Company expects to record a reduction to the 2022 deferred tax asset resulting in a charge to tax expense under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE.\\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, certain deferred income taxes were contributed to the Company by GE. During 2022, a net deferred income tax asset of $\\n80\\n million was contributed to the Company by GE and are recognized within Deferred income taxes in the Combined Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022.\\nAlso, in connection with the Spin-Off, our net deferred income tax assets inc\\nreased by $\\n3,099\\n million primarily due to transfers from GE, including $\\n964\\n million related to pension and postretirement benefits, with the remainder primarily attributable to tax attributes that were not part of the Company\\u0092s stand-alone operations, and changes to valuation on a GE HealthCare basis.\\n100\\nValuation allowances primarily relate to non-U.S. deferred taxes where there were historical losses and U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 consists of the following: \\nValuation Allowances\\nBalance at December 31, 2020\\n$\\n250\\nProvision for income taxes\\n39\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n(\\n10\\n)\\nBalance at December 31, 2021\\n$\\n279\\nProvision for income taxes\\n(\\n5\\n)\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n(\\n2\\n)\\nBalance at December 31, 2022\\n$\\n272\\nProvision for income taxes\\n(\\n12\\n)\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n280\\nBalance at December 31, 2023\\n$\\n540\\nAs a result of the Spin-Off, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $\\n269\\n\\u00a0million, which is included in the Foreign currency exchange and other line of the table above.\\nNET OPERATING LOSSES.\\nAs a result of the Spin-Off, there was an increase in the net operating loss deferred tax asset of $\\n1,075\\n\\u00a0million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $\\n6,526\\n\\u00a0million primarily related to France, Ireland, Brazil, Germany, and the Netherlands, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The gross net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a deferred tax asset of $\\n1,241\\n\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2023. This amount excludes accruals of $\\n149\\n\\u00a0million for unrecognized tax benefits the Company has recorded related to the underlying tax positions which generated the net operating losses and expected impacts to U.S. foreign tax credits of $\\n444\\n\\u00a0million. \\nUNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS.\\nPost Spin-Off, the Company\\u0092s previously undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are no longer indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. businesses due to current U.S. funding needs. Therefore, in 2023, an incremental deferred tax liability of $\\n21\\n million was recorded for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. In addition, the Company is providing for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of current period earnings. However, the Company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon an unforeseen future reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution or disposition to an unrelated third party) of approximately $\\n7,729\\n\\u00a0million to be permanent in duration. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable.\\n101\\nNOTE 12. \\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) \\u0096 NET\\nChanges in AOCI by component, net of income taxes, were as follows.\\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\\nCurrency translation adjustments\\n(1)\\nBenefit plans\\nCash flow hedges\\nTotal AOCI\\nDecember 31, 2020\\n$\\n(\\n643\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n180\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n16\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n839\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclasses \\u0096 net of taxes of $(\\n9\\n), $(\\n57\\n), and $(\\n12\\n)\\n(\\n326\\n)\\n74\\n40\\n(\\n212\\n)\\nReclasses from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n0\\n, $\\n37\\n, and $(\\n3\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n6\\n8\\n14\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n(\\n326\\n)\\n80\\n48\\n(\\n198\\n)\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nDecember 31, 2021\\n(\\n969\\n)\\n(\\n100\\n)\\n32\\n(\\n1,037\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclasses \\u0096 net of taxes of $(\\n5\\n), $(\\n39\\n), and $(\\n10\\n)\\n(\\n878\\n)\\n58\\n27\\n(\\n793\\n)\\nReclasses from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n0\\n, $\\n0\\n, and $\\n17\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n50\\n)\\n(\\n50\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n(\\n878\\n)\\n58\\n(\\n23\\n)\\n(\\n843\\n)\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n(\\n2\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n2\\n)\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n(\\n1,845\\n)\\n(\\n42\\n)\\n9\\n(\\n1,878\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclasses \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(3)\\n of $\\n22\\n, $\\n186\\n, and $\\n1\\n74\\n(\\n601\\n)\\n(\\n5\\n)\\n(\\n532\\n)\\nReclasses from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n0\\n, $\\n97\\n, and $\\n6\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n296\\n)\\n(\\n22\\n)\\n(\\n318\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n74\\n(\\n897\\n)\\n(\\n27\\n)\\n(\\n850\\n)\\nSpin-Off related adjustments \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(4)\\n of $\\n0\\n $(\\n509\\n), and $\\n0\\n28\\n1,972\\n\\u0097\\n2,000\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n(\\n37\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n37\\n)\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n$\\n(\\n1,706\\n)\\n$\\n1,033\\n$\\n(\\n18\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n691\\n)\\n(1) The amount of Currency translation adjustments (\\u0093CTA\\u0094) recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) (\\u0093OCI\\u0094) during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included net gains (losses) relating to net investment hedges, as further discussed in Note 13, \\n\\u0093\\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\\u0094\\n(2) Reclassifications from AOCI into earnings for Benefit plans are recognized within Non-operating benefit (income) loss, while Cash flow hedges are recognized within Cost of products or Cost of services in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\n(3) Includes pre-tax impact to Benefit plans of $(\\n305\\n) million for the pension plan amendment and related remeasurement of plan assets and benefit obligations.

These derivative contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the aforementioned risks. Our policy is to use derivative contracts solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes.\\nThe fair values of derivative contracts are recognized within All other current assets, All other assets, All other current liabilities, and All other liabilities in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Financial Position based upon the contractual timing of settlements for these contracts. We designate certain derivative contracts as hedging instruments in cash flow, fair value, or net investment hedges. We evaluate the effectiveness of our derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments on a quarterly basis.\\n102\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted transactions and firm commitments, including intercompany transactions, denominated in foreign currencies other than a subsidiary\\u0092s functional currency. The maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is \\ntwo years\\n. As of December 31, 2023, these contracts have a maximum remaining maturity of \\n12\\n months.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash\\nflow hedges, changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs and to the same financial statement line item impacted by the hedged transaction. We expect to reclassify $\\n21\\n\\u00a0million of pre-tax net deferred losses associated with designated cash flow hedges to earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the impact on earnings of the related hedged transactions.\\nThe cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Cash from (used for) operating activities in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe use cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts in combination with foreign currency option contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our net investment in foreign operations is approximately \\nfive years\\n. As of December 31, 2023, these contracts have a maximum remaining maturity of \\n52\\n months and were designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations with Euro, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Renminbi functional currencies.\\nWe use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency to USD spot exchange rates are initially recorded and held as a component of the CTA portion of AOCI until the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated. Changes in fair value of the portion of net investment hedging derivatives excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in CTA and then recognized within Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedge. Excluded components on the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges, in the form of accrued interest, are recorded within Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\nThe cash flows associated with derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded in Cash from (used for) investing activities in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from the periodic interest settlements on the cross-currency swaps are recorded in Cash from (used for) operating activities in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on our fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we executed interest-rate swap contracts to hedge the benchmark interest rate risk of specific designated cash flows of a senior unsecured note.\\nWe record the changes in fair value on the swap contracts in Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income, the same line item where the offsetting change in the fair value of the designated cash flows of the senior unsecured note is recorded as a basis adjustment.\",\n",

Under the terms of the Agreement, in return for providing development activities associated with the development of the underlying ultrasound device to deliver Novo\\u0092s clinical therapies, we received an upfront nonrefundable payment with the potential for additional nonrefundable payments over the next \\nfour years\\n. We will recognize the nonrefundable payments as an offset to R&D expense as we perform activities contemplated under the Agreement. These nonrefundable payments are not material. We may also receive future payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones and regulatory approvals associated with the ultrasound therapy.\\n113\\nREDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\\n.\\nThe Company has noncontrolling interests with redemption features. These redemption features, such as put options, could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the occurrence of certain events. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are recognized within the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Financial Position between liabilities and equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are initially recorded at the issuance date fair value. Those that are currently redeemable or probable of becoming redeemable are subsequently adjusted to the greater of current redemption value or initial carrying value. \\nThe activity attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented below.\\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n230\\n$\\n220\\n$\\n223\\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\\n41\\n47\\n39\\nRedemption value adjustments\\n(1)\\n183\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nDistributions to and exercise of redeemable noncontrolling interests and other\\n(2)\\n(\\n289\\n)\\n(\\n37\\n)\\n(\\n42\\n)\\nBalance at end of period \\n$\\n165\\n$\\n230\\n$\\n220\\n(1) As of January 3, 2023, certain redeemable noncontrolling interests were probable of becoming redeemable due to the change of control that occurred upon consummation of the Spin-Off.

The remeasurement was accounted for as a deemed preferred stock dividend of redeemable noncontrolling interest and recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. \\n(2) In the first quarter of 2023, the redeemable noncontrolling interest holder exercised its option redemption provision. The redemption amount of $\\n211\\n million was paid in the second quarter of 2023.\\nOther Income (Expense) \\u0096 Net\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet interest and investment income (expense)\\n$\\n26\\n$\\n(\\n9\\n)\\n$\\n34\\nEquity method income (loss)\\n11\\n13\\n27\\nChange in fair value of assumed obligations\\n(\\n32\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nOther items, net\\n(1)\\n81\\n58\\n62\\nTotal other income (expense) \\u0096 net\\n$\\n86\\n$\\n62\\n$\\n123\\n(1) Other items, net primarily consists of change in tax indemnities with GE, lease income, gains and losses related to derivatives, and licensing and royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2023, and licensing and royalty income and gains and losses related to derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nNOTE 19. \\nRELATED PARTIES\\nPRIOR TO SPIN-OFF.\\nPrior to the Spin-Off, GE provided the Company with significant corporate infrastructure and shared services. Some of these services continue to be provided by GE to the Company on a temporary basis under the Transition Services Agreement, as discussed below. The following disclosures summarize related party activity between GE HealthCare and GE. This activity, which occurred prior to the Spin-Off, is included in the combined financial statements. \\nPensions, Benefit, and Contribution Plans\\nAs discussed in Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094, employees of the Company participated in pensions, benefit, and contribution plans that were sponsored by GE. The Company was charged $\\n207\\n million and $\\n237\\n\\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to employee participation in these plans. In connection with the Spin-Off, a portion of the plans was transferred to the Company. \\n114\\nShare-based Compensation\\nGE granted various employee benefits to its group employees, including those of the Company, under the GE Long-Term Incentive Plan. These benefits primarily included stock options and restricted stock units. Compensation expense allocated to the Company was $\\n67\\n million and $\\n76\\n\\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is primarily recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statements of Income. \\nCorporate Overhead and Other Allocations from GE\\nGE provided certain services described below that were charged to the Company based on employee headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies.\\nCorporate Allocations from GE\\nFor the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nCosts for centralized services\\n(1)\\n$\\n42\\n$\\n56\\nCosts associated with employee medical insurance\\n(2)\\n122\\n132\\nCosts for corporate and shared services\\n(3)\\n457\\n455\\n(1) Costs for centralized services such as public relations, treasury and cash management, and other services were recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statements of Income.\\n(2) Costs associated with employee medical insurance were recognized within Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and R&D in the Combined Statements of Income based on the employee population.\\n(3) Costs for corporate and shared services such as information technology, finance and other services were primarily recognized in SG&A and R&D in the Combined Statements of Income.\\nManagement believes that the expense and cost allocations have been determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts that would have been, or will be, incurred on a stand-alone basis could materially differ from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more or fewer employees, or other factors.\\nAFTER SPIN-OFF.\\nIn\\n connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into or adopted several agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and GE, including, but not limited to, the following which had activity during the year ended December 31, 2023:\\n\\u0095\\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement \\n\\u0096 sets forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off, including the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities, and establishes certain rights and obligations between the Company and GE following the Distribution, including procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.\\n\\u0095\\nTransition Services Agreement \\n\\u0096 governs all matters relating to the provision of services between the Company and GE on a transitional basis. The services the Company receives include support for information technology, human resources, supply chain, finance, and facilities services, among others. Some of these costs were included in the Corporate allocations from GE prior to Spin-Off. The services generally commenced on the date of the Spin-Off and will terminate up to \\n24\\n months following the Distribution Date depending upon the related transitional service. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $\\n372\\n\\u00a0million, net, which represents fees charged from GE to the Company primarily for information technology, human resources, and R&D and is net of fees charged from the Company to GE for facilities and other shared services.\\n\\u0095\\nTax Matters Agreement \\n\\u0096 governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between the Company and GE with respect to all tax matters (excluding employee-related taxes covered under the Employee Matters Agreement), in addition to certain restrictions which generally prohibit us from taking or failing to take any action in the \\ntwo-year\\n period following the Distribution that would prevent the Distribution from qualifying as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including limitations on our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion of tax liability for which the Company will bear contractual responsibility, and the Company and GE will each agree to indemnify each other against any amounts for which such indemnified party is not responsible.\\nCurrent amounts due from and to GE under the various agreements described above are recognized within Due from related parties or \\nDue to related parties, as applicable, in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Financial Position. Non-current amounts due from GE were $\\n81\\n\\u00a0million and due to GE were $\\n33\\n million, and were recognized within All other assets and All other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023. These amounts primarily relate to tax and other indemnities.\\n115\\nNOTE 20. \\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\\nOn March 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our BioPharma business to Danaher Corporation for $\\n20,718\\n\\u00a0million. Activity within discontinued operations for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2023\\n, 2022, and 2021 primarily relates to gain on disposal and Benefit (provision) for income taxes.\\nNOTE 21. \\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\\nOn January 8, 2024, we announced an agreement to acquire MIM Software, a global provider of medical imaging analysis and AI solutions for the practice of radiation oncology, molecular radiotherapy, diagnostic imaging, and urology at imaging centers, hospitals, specialty clinics, and research organizations worldwide. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. \\nOn January 22, 2024, we repaid an additional $\\n150\\n\\u00a0million of the outstanding Term Loan Facility.\\nOn January 22, 2024, we executed an additional $\\n700\\n\\u00a0million of \\ninterest-rate swap contracts to hedge the benchmark interest rate risk of specific designated cash flows of our senior unsecured notes. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.\\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\u0092s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\\u0092s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023, and that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\\u0092s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nMANAGEMENT\\u0092S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\\nThe Company\\u0092s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control \\u0096 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that they were effective as of December 31, 2023. All internal control systems have inherent limitations; as such, they may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. Therefore, even those internal controls systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements preparation and reporting. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the current control structure may become inadequate for changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.\\nThe effectiveness of such controls has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8, \\u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\u0094 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company exited from various transition services arrangements with GE related to IT systems that impact financial reporting. Responsibility for execution of related internal controls transferred to the Company. Management has evaluated effectiveness of these controls as part of its overall internal control over financial reporting evaluation.

        "Based on the baseline and fine-tuned model evaluations, we can summarize the findings and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of fine-tuning GPT-2 with SFTTrainer on this financial Q&A dataset and the impact of the implemented guardrail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluation results:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Baseline Model:** The baseline GPT-2 model, without fine-tuning on this specific dataset, performed poorly on the financial Q&A task, often providing irrelevant or incomplete answers with low confidence scores. This highlights the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.\n",
        "*   **Fine-Tuned Model:** The fine-tuned GPT-2 model with SFTTrainer shows significant improvement. It is able to provide relevant answers to financial questions from the dataset with higher confidence scores. While not perfect (some answers may still contain inaccuracies or require further refinement), it demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised instruction fine-tuning for this task.\n",
        "*   **Guardrail:** The implemented guardrail successfully identified and flagged irrelevant questions (e.g., \"What is the company's stock ticker?\" and \"Who is the CEO of the company?\"), returning a \"Not applicable\" response with high confidence. This is crucial for ensuring the model stays within its intended domain and doesn't provide misleading information for out-of-scope queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like GPT-2 on a domain-specific dataset using SFTTrainer is an effective approach for building a question-answering system for that domain. The addition of a simple guardrail significantly improves the system's robustness by handling irrelevant queries gracefully. Further improvements could involve expanding the training dataset, experimenting with different model architectures, or implementing more sophisticated guardrail mechanisms."
