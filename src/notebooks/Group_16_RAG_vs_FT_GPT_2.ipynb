The increase was due to the following factors: \\n\\u0095\\nGross profit increased $283 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Total revenues primarily due to a reduction in Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold decreased $194 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity, favorable mix within our product offerings, and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold increased $31 million but decreased 80 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $405 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $438 million for the \\nprior year comparable period\\n; and\\n\\u0095\\nTotal operating expenses increased $93 million, with an increase in R&D investments of $106 million and a decrease in Selling, general, and administrative (\\u0093SG&A\\u0094) expense of $13 million primarily driven by cost saving initiatives, including information technology, largely offset by increased restructuring spend. As a result, R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 50 basis points and SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues decreased by 20 basis points.\\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,993 million and 10.1%, an increase of $425 million and 210 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:\\n\\u0095\\nOperating income increased $190 million, as discussed above;\\n\\u0095\\nInterest and other financial charges \\u0096 net decreased $38 million primarily driven by repayments made on the Term Loan Facility;\\n\\u0095\\nNon-operating benefit income increased $24 million primarily related to the amortization of net gains on our pension plans;\\n\\u0095\\nOther income \\u0096 net decreased $31 million primarily driven by favorable impacts from Net financing and investment income in the prior year driven by impacts from the revaluation of investments; and\\n\\u0095\\nProvision for income taxes decreased $212 million primarily due to the release of the France valuation allowance partially offset by the establishment of a reserve for ongoing audits in France. In the prior year, there were larger non-recurring impacts from the Tax Matters Agreement with GE as well as an incremental charge for the accrual of withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, \\u0093Income Taxes.\\u0094\\nAdjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $3,211 million and 16.3%, an increase of $255 million and 120 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Gross profit, partially offset by investment in R&D.\\nAdjusted net income*\\nwas $2,060 million, an increase of $263 million primarily due to an increase in Gross profit and lower Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net, partially offset by investment in R&D.\\n____________________\\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\\n43\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\\nOperating income was $2,435 million, a decrease of $87 million and 130 basis points as a percent of Total revenues. The decrease as a percent of Total revenues was due to the following factors:\\n\\u0095\\nCost of products sold increased $490 million but decreased 170 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold decreased $22 million or 130 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $438 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $429 million for the \\nprior year comparable period\\n; and\\n\\u0095\\nTotal operating expenses increased $830 million due to an increase in SG&A expense of $651 million driven by increased costs associated with both the one-time stand-up and recurring operations of a stand-alone company and commercial and marketing investments and an increase in R&D investments of $179 million. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 210 basis points and R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 60 basis points.\\nNet income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,568 million and 8.0%, a decrease of $348 million and 240 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:\\n\\u0095\\nOperating income decreased $87 million, as discussed above;\\n\\u0095\\nInterest and other financial charges \\u0096 net increased $465 million primarily due to interest expense related to the debt securities issued by GE HealthCare in November of 2022 and the Term Loan Facility drawn upon in January of 2023;\\n\\u0095\\nNon-operating benefit income increased $377 million primarily related to the pension plans transferred to GE HealthCare as part of the Spin-Off; and\\n\\u0095\\nProvision for income taxes increased $180 million primarily due to t\\nhe tax effect of foreign currency movement, the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement, including the effect of completing the 2022 U.S. federal tax return\\n, taxes accrued for the future repatriation of current earnings with a one-time charge for prior period earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to stand-alone GE HealthCare tax rates. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, \\u0093Income Taxes.\\u0094\\nAdjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $2,956 million and 15.1%, an increase of $95 million but a decrease of 50 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Total revenues, offset by an increase in Total operating expenses, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.\\nAdjusted net income*\\nwas $1,797 million, a decrease of $306 million primarily due to higher Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net, partially offset by an increase in Operating Income, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n\\u0096\\n SEGMENTS\\nWe exclude from Segment EBIT certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our Chief Operating Decision Maker (which is our Chief Executive Officer) considers to be non-operational, such as Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net, Benefit (provision) for income taxes, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), Spin-Off and separation costs, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and investment revaluation gain (loss).

When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for making financial, operational, and planning decisions. Descriptions of the reported non-GAAP measures are included below.\\nWe report Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate to provide management and investors with additional understanding and visibility into the underlying revenue trends of our established, ongoing operations, as well as provide insights into overall demand for our products and services. To calculate these measures, we exclude the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\\nWe report EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings per share to provide management and investors with additional understanding of our business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors, on a normalized basis. To calculate these measures we exclude, and reflect in the detailed reconciliations below, the following adjustments as applicable: Interest and other financial charges \\n\\u0096\\n net, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, Benefit (provision) for income taxes and certain tax related adjustments, and certain non-recurring and/or non-cash items. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted EBIT margin is calculated by taking Adjusted EBIT divided by Total revenues for the same period.\\nWe report Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted ETR to provide management and investors with a better understanding of the normalized tax rate applicable to our business and provide more consistent comparability across periods. A\\ndjusted tax expense excludes the income tax related to the pre-tax income adjustments included as part of Adjusted net income and certain income tax adjustments, such as adjustments to deferred tax assets or liabilities. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring tax items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted ETR is Adjusted tax expense divided by income before income taxes less the pre-tax income adjustments referenced above.\\nWe report Free cash flow to provide management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis and provide insight into our flexibility to allocate capital\\n. Free cash flow is Cash from (used for) operating activities \\u0096 continuing operations including cash flows related to the additions and dispositions of property, plant, and equipment (\\u0093PP&E\\u0094) and additions of internal-use software.\\n Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the capital required for debt repayments.\\nManagement recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes. In order to compensate for the discussed limitations, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are provided below, and no single financial measure should be relied on to

This includes a \\n$1,000\\u00a0million a\\nggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by the Company in the third quarter of 2024, and a repayment in the fourth quarter of 2024 of \\n$1,000\\u00a0million\\n of senior unsecured notes. \\nThe decrease in debt was due primarily to repayments of \\n$150\\u00a0million\\n and \\n$250\\u00a0million\\n of the outstanding Term Loan Facility in the first and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively.\\nThe weighted average interest rate for the Notes and our Credit Facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 5.99%.\\nIn addition to the Term Loan Facility, our credit facilities include a five-year senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $2,500\\u00a0million expiring in January 2028, and a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $1,000\\u00a0million expiring in December 2025. As of \\nDecember 31, 2024\\n, there were no outstanding borrowings on either of the two revolving facilities.\\nThe Credit Facilities include various customary covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens securing debt, the entry into certain fundamental change transactions by GE HealthCare, and the maximum permitted leverage ratio. As of \\nDecember 31, 2024\\n, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements, including the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. \\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we accessed the capital markets and raised $10,250 million of debt by issuing \\n$8,250\\u00a0million\\n of senior unsecured notes in November 2022, completed a drawdown of the Term Loan Facility of \\n$2,000\\u00a0million\\n in January 2023, and arranged $3,500 million of revolving credit facilities to further support our liquidity needs. In the third quarter of 2024, we issued \\n$1,000\\u00a0million\\n aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2029. We plan to continue to rely on capital markets, and we expect to have access to credit facilities to fund our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing will be influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions.

We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\\nTo prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management\\u0092s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Business Combination Related Measurements, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Income Taxes. \\nSee Note 2, \\u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\u0094 for further information on our significant accounting policies.\\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\\nOur revenues are recorded based on the consideration specified in customer contracts net of any sales incentives, discounts, returns, chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees, rebates, or credits, which are accounted for as estimated variable consideration. Our estimates for these deductions are based upon historical experience and consider current and forecasted market trends. We record the estimated amounts as a reduction to revenue when we recognize the related product or service sale. \\nChargebacks are a form of variable consideration that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the contracted customer. A provision for outstanding chargebacks is recorded at the time we recognize revenue from the sale to the wholesaler and requires certain estimates such as the wholesaler chargeback rates, the expected sell-through levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. \\nThe amounts of variable consideration included in the net transaction price for revenue recognition are limited to the amounts that are estimated to be probable of occurrence to avoid a material revenue reversal in a future period. \\nSee Note 3, \\u0093Revenue Recognition\\u0094 for further information on revenue recognition and Note 5, \\u0093Receivables\\u0094 for further information on chargebacks.\\nBUSINESS COMBINATION RELATED MEASUREMENTS. \\nOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the combination. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration we may be liable to pay in the future, are recorded on the date of the business combination at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Our business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense. The fair values of acquired intangible assets and liabilities are determined using information available at the business combination date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable. Significant assumptions vary by the class of asset or liability and the valuation technique used. These assumptions can include: the discount rates; timing; probability of achieving regulatory and commercialization milestones; and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, growth rates, royalty rates, and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage third-party valuation specialists who review our critical assumptions and prepare the calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant business combinations.\\n52\\nSee Note 8, \\u0093Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\\u0094 for further information on our business combinations.\\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.\\nPension and other postretirement benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and related asset and liability measurement. The Company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. The Company periodically evaluates other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and updates them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. \\nProjected benefit obligations (\\u0093PBO\\u0094) are measured as the present value of expected payments. We discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the expected timing of benefit payments. \\nA 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2025 and PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (\\u0093APBO\\u0094) as of December 31, 2024:\\nDiscount Rate Sensitivity\\nU.S. Plans\\nInternational Plans\\nOther Postretirement Plans\\n50 bps increase in discount rate\\nImpact on PBO/APBO as of December 31, 2024\\n$\\n(812)\\n$\\n(195)\\n$\\n(32)\\nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2025\\n37\\u00a0\\n2\\u00a0\\n3\\u00a0\\n50 bps decrease in discount rate\\nImpact on PBO/APBO as of December 31, 2024\\n$\\n885\\u00a0\\n$\\n215\\u00a0\\n$\\n33\\u00a0\\nImpact on service cost and interest cost in 2025\\n(43)\\n(3)\\n(2)\\nThe sensitivity of the net deficit to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan\\u0092s asset allocation.\\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans\\u0092 assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields, and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also consider expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. A 1% change in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the 2025 net periodic benefit costs of these plans by $194 million.\\nOur pension plan assets contain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. While the majority of these assets are valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets, the fair value of certain assets is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These assets primarily relate to real estate and private equity investments.\\nFor pension benefits and retiree health and life benefits transferred from GE on January 1, 2023, third-party actuaries were engaged to assist in the valuation of transferred pension assets and liabilities using assumptions provided by GE which the Company reviewed prior to recording amounts in our combined financial statements.\\nWe disclose in the following table postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $50 million as of December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094 for further details related to these plans. The value of the assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, are summarized in the table below.\\nProjected benefit obligations\\nFair value of plan assets\\nFunded status - surplus (deficit)\\nGE HealthCare Pension Plan\\n$\\n15,230\\u00a0\\n$\\n13,650\\u00a0\\n$\\n(1,580)\\nGE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan\\n1,886\\u00a0\\n\\u0097\\u00a0\\n(1,886)\\nOther U.S. Pension Plans\\n1,125\\u00a0\\n727\\u00a0\\n(398)\\nTotal U.S. Plans\\n18,241\\u00a0\\n14,378\\u00a0\\n(3,863)\\nInternational Plans\\n2,957\\u00a0\\n3,276\\u00a0\\n319\\u00a0\\nOPEB Plans\\n(1)\\n1,016\\u00a0\\n\\u0097\\u00a0\\n(1,016)\\nTotal\\n$\\n22,214\\n$\\n17,654\\n$\\n(4,561)\\n(1) As defined in Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans.\\u0094\\n53\\nINCOME TAXES.\\nFor periods prior to the Spin-Off, GE HealthCare is included in the combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns of GE, where eligible. However, we have adopted the separate return method for purposes of our combined financial statements. The income tax provisions reflected in our combined financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022 have been estimated as if we were a separate taxpayer. \\nOur annual tax expense is based on our income, applicable statutory tax rates, and tax incentives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly impact the estimate of our tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years to the extent applicable, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates; we use our historical experience as well as our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.\\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the change in the technical merit of a position, or an uncertain tax position is effectively settled with the relevant taxing authority, or the statute of limitations has expired. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these changes; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. \\nSee Note 11, \\u0093Income Taxes\\u0094 for further information on income taxes.\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, and equity prices, which may impact future income, cash flows, and fair value of our business. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations, or the fair value interest rate risk of our financial instruments bearing fixed interest by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of such risks. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative contracts to the extent they meet the objectives described above, and not for speculative purposes. See Note 13, \\u0093Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\u0094 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.\\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.\\nAs a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses, including those arising from intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign operations creating exposure to foreign currency translation risk. Such principal currencies include the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen, the Norwegian Krone, and the British Pound Sterling, among others. Operating entities with functional currencies other than the USD also create exposure to foreign currency risk realized upon their sale or a complete or substantially complete liquidation.\\nWe use a number of techniques to manage the effects of foreign currency exchange risk, including hedging of significant currency exposures. We use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts and economic hedges when we have exposures to foreign currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting. We use net investment hedging to hedge the foreign currency risk of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates against the USD. As a result of the above mitigating activities, we have been able to significantly reduce the financial impact of volatility from currency fluctuations.\\nThe potential decrease in fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts from a 10% decrease in USD spot rates against other applicable currencies would have been $82\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2024. This excludes foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges as changes in the fair value of those contracts are not expected to impact earnings. The sensitivity analysis assumes a uniform weakening of USD spot rates against the other applicable currencies, compared to the actual exchange rates applied as of December 31, 2024, with all other factors remaining constant. This sensitivity analysis disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged currency exposures in earnings.\\n54\\nThe effect arising from foreign currency transactions, including the remeasurement of derivatives mentioned above, can result in significant fluctuations at points in time, but generally will be offset as the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. The global nature of our customer base and manufacturing footprint allows for the natural offset of certain income and costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Note 2, \\u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\u0094 for net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK.\\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to the fair value of our borrowings bearing fixed interest rates and variability of cash flows related to our investments and borrowings bearing variable interest rates.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have $8,250\\u00a0million of fixed-rate debt and $750\\u00a0million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility which carries a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2024, we have $2,889 million of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, of which $1,885 million is invested in short-term investments that generate income based on variable interest rates.\\nA change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and would impact our earnings and cash flows associated with our floating-rate debt. A hypothetical change of interest rates by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $35\\u00a0million, partially offset by the change in interest income from our cash investments.\\nWe primarily manage interest rate risk by using a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, we executed an aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap contracts to synthetically convert $2,700 million of our senior unsecured notes from fixed rates to variable rates as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.\\nCOMMODITY RISK.\\nWe rely upon supplies of certain raw materials including helium, iodine, and rare earth minerals. Worldwide demand, availability, and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future. If supply of these materials is restricted or if prices increase, this could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers, and patients who may rely on our products.\\nSimilarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility. If the costs of certain commodities or of energy, shipping, or transportation increase and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nDisruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities (including as a result of war, natural disasters, climate change-related physical and transitional risks, actual or threatened public health emergencies, or other business continuity events) adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. \\nWe may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from commodity price fluctuations. The impact of commodity hedges is recognized in earnings in the applicable current period.\\nEQUITY RISK.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have $260 million of deferred compensation liabilities subject to the risk of changes in equity prices. A change in the U.S equity markets would result in a corresponding change in the value of these deferred compensation liabilities, which would impact our earnings and cash flows. We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from equity price fluctuations.\\n55\\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\nPart II.

(the \\\"Company\\\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated and combined statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\\"financial statements\\\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter \\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nIncome Taxes \\u0096 Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets \\u0097 Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\\nCritical Audit Matter Description\\nThe Company recognizes deferred income taxes for tax attributes and for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies.\\nThe Company\\u0092s determination of the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets involves judgments and estimates, including the projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income. Auditing management\\u0092s projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income, which affect the recorded valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.\\n57\\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\\nWith the assistance of our income tax specialists, our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize certain net deferred tax assets included the following, among others: \\n\\u0095\\nWe considered relevant tax laws and regulations in evaluating the appropriateness of management\\u0092s estimates of future sources of taxable income.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\\u0092s estimates of future sources of taxable income by comparing the estimates to historical sources of taxable income or loss.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated management\\u0092s projected timing and projected pattern of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\\n\\u0095\\nWe evaluated whether the estimated future sources of taxable income were of the appropriate character to utilize the deferred tax assets under tax law.\\n/s/ \\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\\nChicago, Illinois\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\nWe have served as the Company\\u0092s auditor since 2022. \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the \\u0093Company\\u0094) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u0097 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company\\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\u0092s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n58\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ \\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\\nChicago, Illinois\\nFebruary 13, 2025\\n59\\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Income\\nFor the years ended

            "  \"Statements of Financial Position / Balance Sheet\": \". Restricted cash primarily relates to funds restricted in connection with escrow accounts and other contractual and legal restrictions. \\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, which was prior to the Spin-Off\\n, the cash presented in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows represents cash not subject to the GE centralized cash management process. Cash held in commingled accounts with GE, or its affiliates, is presented within Net parent investment in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Changes in Equity.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information.\\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES.\\nPublicly traded equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. Privately held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative approach and are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, with changes in the measurement recognized through Other (income) expense \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\\n176\\n\\u00a0million and $\\n156\\n\\u00a0million, respectively. Investment securities are recognized within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. \\nEquity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. Equity method investments are recognized within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other (income) expense \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information.\\nRECEIVABLES. \\nAmounts due from customers arising from the sales of products and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowances for credit losses, chargebacks, and other credits. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables.\\nSee Note 5\\n, \\u0093\\nReceivables\\n\\u0094\\n for further information.\\n67\\nFINANCING RECEIVABLES. \\nOur financing receivables portfolio consists of a variety of loans and leases, including both larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans and leases, and smaller-balance homogeneous loans and leases. \\nLoans\\nLoans represent term loans that are collateralized by equipment and other assets. Loans are classified as either held for sale or held for investment (\\u0093HFI\\u0094) based on management\\u0092s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans where the Company does not have the ability and intent to hold for investment purposes and those where the Company intends to hold for sale in the foreseeable future are accounted for as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or current fair value with any fair value write-down (or change to the write-down) recorded as a valuation allowance through current period earnings in the period in which the change occurs. Loans classified as HFI are recorded at amortized cost. \\nInvestment in Finance Leases \\nFinance leases include mostly sales-type leases of equipment and represent net unpaid rentals and estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment, less related deferred income and less the allowance for credit losses. \\nSee Note 7, \\u0093Leases\\u0094 for further information on our finance leases and \\u0093Allowance for credit losses\\u0094 below for the Company\\u0092s policy regarding allowances for credit losses on financing receivables. \\nCredit Quality Indicators \\nWe manage our financing receivables portfolio using delinquency and nonaccrual data as key performance indicators. We assess the overall quality of the portfolio based on a potential risk of loss measure. The metric incorporates both the borrower\\u0092s credit quality along with any related collateral protection. Financing receivables are considered past due if default on a contractual principal or interest payment exists for a period of 30 days or more. We stop accruing interest on financing receivables at the earlier of when collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due. Although we stop accruing interest in advance of payments, we recognize income within Other (income) expense \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income when we determine that the account is returned to accrual status, provided that the amount does not exceed that which would have been earned at the historical effective interest rate.\\nSee \\nNote 6, \\u0093Financing Receivables\\u0094\\n for further information.\\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\\n. \\nWhen we record customer receivables, contract assets, and financing receivables, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. The credit losses are recognized within Selling, general, and administrative (\\u0093SG&A\\u0094) in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. For financing receivables, expected credit losses are calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, multiplied by a factor reflecting the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. \\nWe routinely evaluate our entire portfolio for potential specific credit or collection issues that might indicate an impairment.\\nWe estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information from past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\\nINVENTORIES. \\nInventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable values. Cost of inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\\nInventories are generally classified as current, however, based on consumption timelines, certain inventories are considered non-current and are recognized, net of related reserves, within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\\nAs necessary, we record provisions and write-downs for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to historical utilization and estimates of future product demand, market conditions, and technological developments.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information. \\n68\\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT. \\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives generally range from \\n8\\n to \\n40\\n years for buildings, structures and related equipment, \\n3\\n to \\n20\\n years for machinery and equipment, and \\n1\\n to \\n15\\n years for leasehold improvements. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information.\\nLEASES.\\nLessee Arrangements\\nAt lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (\\u0093ROU\\u0094) asset. ROU assets are recognized within Property, plant, and equipment \\u0096 net and lease liabilities are recognized within All other current liabilities and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Options to extend a lease are included as part of the ROU lease asset and liability at commencement when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets except our vehicle leases. Non-lease components are generally related to services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset. As the Company\\u0092s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease commencement for leases that commenced post-Spin-Off and GE\\u0092s incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease commencement for leases that commenced pre-Spin-Off. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, an ROU asset and lease liability are not recognized, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our leases include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on, but not limited to, maintenance, insurance, taxes, index escalations, and usage-based amounts. The Company recognizes variable lease payments not included in its lease liabilities in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. We review ROU assets for impairment annually or \\nwhen events occur or circumstances change that \\nindicate that the asset may be impaired.\\nLessor Arrangements \\nEquipment leased to others under operating leases is recognized within Property, plant, and equipment \\u0096 net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Leases classified as sales-type leases or direct finance leases are recognized within All other current assets and All other non-current assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The terms of the related contracts, including the proportion of fixed versus variable payments and any options to shorten or extend the lease term or purchase the underlying asset, vary by customer.\\nSee Note 6, \\u0093Financing Receivables\\u0094 and Note 7, \\u0093Leases\\u0094 for further information.\\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each year as of October 1\\nst\\n, or more frequently \\nwhen an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the reporting unit\\u0092s carrying value and its fair value.\\n When performing a quantitative test, the market approach is typically used for estimating the fair values for our reporting units. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Depending on the specific reporting unit circumstances, we may also consider performing a valuation based on an income approach. \\nIt is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates used could change in future periods.\\n69\\nIn-proce\\nss research and development (\\u0093IPR&D\\u0094) acquired as part of a business acquisition is capitalized at fair value \\nwhen acquired and is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year or when events occur or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. When testing IPR&D for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that the IPR&D is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the IPR&D\\u0092s carrying value and its fair value. When the IPR&D project is complete, the asset is considered a finite-lived intangible asset and subject to an impairment test at that date. Thereafter, the resulting asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and is subject to impairment assessments in the same manner as all amortizing intangible assets.\\nFor other intangible assets that are not deemed indefinite-lived, the cost of the intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset\\u0092s estimated useful life. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. \\nInternal-use software is software that is developed, purchased, or modified to meet internal needs and for which no substantive plan exists to sell, lease, or otherwise market the software externally. All costs associated with project tasks classified in the preliminary project development or post-implementation/operation stage are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of application development stage costs begins after both of the following occur: (1) the preliminary project development stage is completed and (2) management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the purpose for which it was intended. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete. Capitalized amounts are recognized within Other intangible assets \\u0096 net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset\\u0092s estimated useful life. \\nExternal use software relates to software that is (1) intended to be sold, licensed, or marketed to our customers or (2) embedded and integral to our tangible products for which research and development (\\u0093R&D\\u0094) has been completed. Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of software are expensed as incurred. Costs that are incurred after technological feasibility has been established until general release of the product are capitalized as an intangible asset and recognized within Other intangible assets \\u0096 net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Capitalized costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are amortized on an individual product basis using straight-line amortization over the estimated useful life of the product. The Company performs regular reviews to assess whether unamortized capitalized external use software program costs remain recoverable through future revenue.\\nSee Note 8, \\u0093Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\\u0094 for further information. \\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. \\nWe use derivative contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices. Our policy is to \\nuse derivatives solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes. \\nWe employ the following hedge types: (1) cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk associated with third-party and intercompany foreign currency-denominated forecasted transactions and firm commitments, (2) net investment hedges of foreign currency risk associated with investments in foreign operations, (3) fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with long-term borrowings, and (4) economic hedges not designated as qualifying hedging relationships of foreign currency risk associated with monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances, equity price risk, and commodity price risk.\\nFor net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the components of the hedging derivatives excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred and amortized to earnings in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the derivative transaction.\\nContracts that do not in their entirety meet the definition of a derivative instrument and are not measured at fair value may contain embedded features affecting some or all of the cash flows or value of other exchanges that would otherwise be considered derivatives when assessed separately from the host contract. Such embedded features are separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative measured at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract.\\nS\\nee Note 13, \\u0093Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\u0094 for furthe\\nr information.\\n70\\nINCOME TAXES.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, which was prior to the Spin-Off, the Company\\u0092s income tax provision was determined using the separate return method. As a result, actual amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of GE related to the Company may differ from the amounts included in our financial statements. For post Spin-Off periods we file tax returns on our own behalf, and our deferred taxes and actual income tax rate may differ from those in the historical pre Spin-Off periods.\\nUncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are included in the financial statements. Such uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that the Company believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the change in the technical merit of a position, an uncertain tax position is effectively settled with the relevant taxing authority, or the statute of limitations has expired. Penalties and interest related to income tax matters are recognized within Benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. \\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred income tax balances are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when those taxes are paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits considering all available positive and negative evidence, including the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement with GE, specifically assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, if applicable, and available tax planning strategies. To the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established to reduce its carrying value to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred taxes are provided for the outside basis difference of certain investments in non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies based upon our evaluation of the undistributed earnings of such entities if the permanently reinvested assumption cannot be made.\\nSee Note 11\\n, \\u0093\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\u0094\\n for further information.\\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. \\nPrior to the Spin-Off, GE sponsored plans were accounted for as multiemployer plans. Therefore, the Combined Statement of Income reflects a proportionate allocation of net periodic benefit costs for the multiemployer plans associated with the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022. \\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, on January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare assumed a portion of former GE pension and other postretirement obligations and assets. The pension and other postretirement obligations assumed relate to benefits owed to current GE HealthCare employees, former GE HealthCare employees, and certain GE legacy plan participants. As of January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare established the assumed pension plans as single-employer plans, but continued to participate in legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans sponsored by GE. \\nOn January 1, 2024, we transitioned from the legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans to a GE HealthCare sponsored single-employer postretirement benefit plan. This change did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.\\nManagement accounts for the pension and postretirement plans as defined benefit plans. \\nWe measure our plan assets at fair value and categorize plan assets for disclosure purposes in accordance with the fair value hierarchy\\n. Certain assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value (\\u0093NAV\\u0094) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The components of net periodic benefit costs, other than the service cost component, are recognized within Non-operating benefit (income) costs in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income for plans sponsored by the Company.\\nWe engage third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of benefit obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. We develop significant long-term assumptions, including discount rates and the expected rate of return on assets in connection with our pension accounting. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement, we recognize differences between expected long-term return on plan assets and actual returns, and net actuarial gains and losses for the pension plan liabilities within the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\\nWe amortize gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, that exceed 10% of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or benefit obligations, determined as of the beginning of the year. The period over which gains and losses are amortized to earnings is generally over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\\nSee Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094 for further information.\\n71\\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. \\nLoss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, product warranties, claims, litigation, environmental obligations, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality, and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the loss. When there appears to be a range of possible losses with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable and an estimate can be made, when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\\nSee \\nNote 14\\n, \\u0093\\nCommitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies\\n\\u0094 for further information. \\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMS. \\nThe Company participates in voluntary supply chain finance programs which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their GE HealthCare receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure the use of a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables does not change the nature, existence, amount, or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any characteristics of the trade payables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables to borrowings. \\nIn connection with the supply chain finance programs, payment terms normally range from \\n30\\n to \\n180\\n days, depending on the underlying supplier agreements.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information. \\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. \\nThe following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments at fair value including certain assets within our postretirement benefit plans. Observable inputs for fair value measurements reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish the following fair value hierarchy:\\n\\u0095\\nLevel 1 \\u0097 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \\n\\u0095\\nLevel 2 \\u0097 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. \\n\\u0095\\nLevel 3 \\u0097 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. \\nSee \\nNote 13\\n, \\u0093\\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\n\\u0094 for further information.\\nRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. \\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily money market funds, investment securities, derivatives, and contingent consideration, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. \\nMoney Market Funds\\nMoney market funds are valued using pricing information from the fund managers, quoted on a daily basis, and are considered Level 2 inputs.\\nInvestment Securities\\nPublicly traded equity securities are valued using Level 1 quoted price inputs.\\n72\\nDerivatives\\nThe majority of our derivatives are valued using model-derived offers received from financial institutions for similar over-the-counter instruments without an active market or internal models. The models maximize observable inputs including interest rates and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, foreign currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity exchange contracts, embedded derivatives, and the equity-linked total return swap were valued using Level 2 inputs.\\nContingent Consideration\\nWhen an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we record on the date of acquisition a liability for the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future. The fair value is based upon estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios using a probability-weighted expected payment model discounted to present value. The estimates used to determine the fair value are subject to significant judgment and as such are considered Level 3 inputs. We subsequently remeasure such liabilities at the end of each reporting period and record changes in the fair value within SG&A in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\nInvestments in Private Equity, Real Estate and Collective Funds held within our Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nMost investments are generally valued using the NAV per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. Investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments classified within Level 3 primarily relate to real estate and private equities which are valued using unobservable inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094 for further information.\\nDebt Securities held within our Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nWhen available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are Level 1 inputs. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor\\u0092s models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. These investments are classified within Level 2. See Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094 for further information.\\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 13, \\u0093Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\u0094 for further information.\\nNON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. \\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. \\nThese items may include financing receivables and long-lived assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale and impaired equity method investments and long-lived assets, which, when written down to fair value upon an impairment, are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. \\nThe following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure these assets not measured on a recurring fair value basis.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nEquity method investments are initially recorded at cost and are adjusted in each period for the Company\\u0092s share of the investee\\u0092s income or loss and dividends paid. \\nIn instances of impairment, equity method investments are written down to fair value using market observable data such as quoted prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches, as appropriate. These investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.\\nEquity Investments\\n Without Readily Determinable Fair Value\\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value, subject to a policy choice on a transaction-by-transaction basis, are accounted for under the measurement alternative at cost less impairment and adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in or\\nderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. In the instance of impairment, if any, equity investments are adjusted to fair value using market observable data if available. If market observable data is not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow models, comparative market multiples, or a combination of these approaches using Level 3 inputs.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nWe generally use market data, including pricing on recently closed market transactions, to value financing receivables that are held for sale. Such financing receivables are valued using Level 2 inputs. When the data is unobservable, we use valuation methodologies based on current market interest rate data adjusted for inherent credit risk. Such financing receivables are valued using Level 3 inputs. \\nLong-Lived Assets\\nFair values of long-lived assets are primarily developed internally and are corroborated by available external appraisal information, as applicable. \\nThese assets are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.\\n73\\nFOREIGN CURRENCY. \\nWe have determined that the functional currency for many of our international operations is the local currency, and for other international operations the functional currency is the USD. The basis of this determination is the currency in which each of the international operations primarily generates and expends cash. When the functional currency is not the USD, asset and liability accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates. The Company translates functional currency income and expense amounts to their USD equivalents using average exchange rates for the period. These translation gains and losses are recognized within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \\u0096 net (\\u0093AOCI\\u0094) in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of monetary items in the non-functional currency and those resulting from remeasurements of monetary items, are included in Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and R&D in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income, depending on the underlying nature of the item.\\n Net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions were $\\n16\\n million, $\\n16\\n million, and $(\\n88\\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS. \\nOur financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. When we acquire the remaining equity ownership of a company in which we hold an equity interest, we remeasure our equity interest to fair value. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as Goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. For those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, on the date of acquisition we record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future.\\nSee Note 8, \\u0093Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\\u0094 and Note 13, \\u0093Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\\u0094 for further information. \\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. \\nCertain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or are spun-off. Presentation as discontinued operations is consistent for all periods presented.\\nRESTRUCTURING COSTS. \\nWe record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.\\nSee Note 15, \\u0093Restructuring Activities\\u0094 for further information.\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. \\nThe Company conducts R&D activities to create new products, develop new applications for existing products, and enhance existing products. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. \\nIn certain instances, R&D activities may be funded by third parties, including government entities. These R&D funding arrangements may include upfront payments, R&D cost sharing payments, and future milestone payments that may be based upon the occurrence of future R&D or commercialization events. Payments received as part of the R&D funding arrangements are generally presented as an offset to R&D expense.\\nCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS.\\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements primarily related to development of new products. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves two or more parties who are active participants in the activity, and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. The assessment for a collaborative arrangement is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties. Amounts that are owed by collaboration partners related to R&D activities are generally presented as an offset to R&D expense.\\nSee Note 18, \\u0093Supplemental Financial Information\\u0094 for further information. \\n74\\nACCOUNTING CHANGES.\\nAccounting Standards Codification (\\u0093ASC\\u0094) Topic 740, \\nIncome Taxes\\n, provides that interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits may either be classified as income tax expense or interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its accounting policy for presentation of interest expense on uncertain tax positions. The interest wa\\ns previously presented within Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net and has changed to being presented within Benefit (provision) for income taxes. The Company believes this presentation is preferable because the cost is related to income tax matters and this presentation enhances comparability with our peers. The effects of the change in accounting have been prospectively applied to periods beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and were not material to any previously reported periods prior to March 31, 2023. \\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Reflected in These Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u0093FASB\\u0094) issued Accounting Standards Update (\\u0093ASU\\u0094) No. 2023-07 (\\u0093ASU 2023-07\\u0094), \\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\n. ASU 2023-07 requires annual and interim disclosures that are expected to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The provisions of ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended December 31, 2024, retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. See Note 4, \\u0093Segment and Geographical Information\\u0094 for further information.\\nOther Recent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 (\\u0093ASU 2023-09\\u0094), \\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\\n. ASU 2023-09 addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on the disclosures in our notes to the financial statements.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 (\\u0093ASU 2024-03\\u0094), \\nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\\n. ASU 2024-03 addresses investor requests for more transparency about expense information through the disaggregation of relevant expense captions in the notes to the financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2024-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We expect the adoption to impact disclosures in our notes to the financial statements.\\nNOTE 3. \\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\\nCONTRACT AND OTHER DEFERRED ASSETS.\\nContract assets reflect revenue recognized on contracts with customers in excess of billings based on contractual terms. Contract assets are classified as current or non-current based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the Company\\u0092s right to consideration becomes unconditional. Other deferred assets consist of costs to obtain contracts, primarily commissions, other cost deferrals for shipped products, and deferred service, labor, and direct overhead costs.\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nContract assets\\n$\\n589\\n$\\n600\\nOther deferred assets\\n385\\n400\\nContract and other deferred assets\\n974\\n1,000\\nNon-current contract assets\\n(1)\\n103\\n72\\nNon-current other deferred assets\\n(1)\\n105\\n96\\nTotal contract and other deferred assets\\n$\\n1,183\\n$\\n1,168\\n(1)\\nNon-current contract and other deferred assets are recognized within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\\n217\\n million and $\\n213\\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Generally, these costs are recognized within \\ntwo years\\n of being capitalized. When recognized, the costs to obtain a contract are recorded within SG&A in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\n75\\nCONTRACT LIABILITIES.\\nContract liabilities include customer advances and deposits received when orders are placed and billed in advance of completion of performance obligations. Contract liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the periods over which these remaining performance obligations are expected to be satisfied with our customers.\\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, contract liabilities were approximately $\\n2,629\\n million and $\\n2,623\\n million, respectively, of which the non-current portion of $\\n686\\n million and $\\n705\\n million, respectively, was recognized in All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Revenue recognized related to the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the year was approximately $\\n1,585\\n million and $\\n1,554\\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nREMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.\\nRemaining performance obligations (\\u0093RPO\\u0094) represents the estimated revenue expected from customer contracts that are partially or fully unperformed inclusive of amounts deferred in contract liabilities, excluding contracts, or portions thereof, that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty.\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nProducts\\n$\\n4,755\\n$\\n4,930\\nServices\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n9,737\\n9,725\\nTotal RPO\\n$\\n14,491\\n$\\n14,655\\nWe expect to recognize substantially all of the revenue for our product-related RPO within \\ntwo years\\n and services-related RPO within \\nfive years\\n.\\nNOTE 4. \\nSEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\\nEffective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies, previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions. Following this realignment, the Company continues to have \\nfour\\n reportable segments: Imaging, AVS, PCS, and PDx. Historical segment financial information presented within this report has been recast to conform to the new reportable segments structure.\\nThe Company\\u0092s organizational structure is based upon the availability of separate financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Company\\u0092s Chief Operating Decision Maker (\\u0093CODM\\u0094) for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company\\u0092s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products sold and how the Company manages its operations. We have not aggregated any of our operating segments to form reportable segments. A description of our reportable segments has been provided in Item 1, \\u0093Business\\u0094 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nThe CODM assesses segment performance using Total revenues and an earnings metric defined as \\u0093Segment EBIT.\\u0094 Segment EBIT is calculated as income before income taxes in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income excluding the impact of the following: Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, Spin-Off and separation costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and investment revaluation gain (loss). Segment EBIT is also used in the annual budget and periodic forecasting processes and informs the CODM in decision making regarding the allocation of resources to the segments.\\n76\\nTotal Revenues by Segment\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nTotal Imaging\\n$\\n8,855\\n$\\n8,944\\n$\\n8,395\\nAVS:\\nProcedural Guidance\\n2,711\\n2,666\\n2,327\\nSpecialized Ultrasound\\n2,420\\n2,428\\n2,685\\nTotal AVS\\n5,131\\n5,094\\n5,012\\nPCS:\\nMonitoring Solutions\\n2,194\\n2,283\\n2,092\\nLife Support Solutions\\n931\\n859\\n824\\nTotal PCS\\n3,125\\n3,142\\n2,916\\nTotal PDx\\n2,508\\n2,306\\n1,958\\nOther\\n(1)\\n52\\n66\\n60\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n19,672\\n$\\n19,552\\n$\\n18,341\\n(1) Financial information not presented within the reportable segments, shown within the Other category, represents Hea\\nlthCar\\ne Financial Services (\\u0093HFS\\u0094) which does not meet the definition of an operating segment.\\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\\u0092s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.

NMP is a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer in Japan, focused on radiopharmaceuticals, which are used to enable clinical images across neurology, cardiology, and oncology procedures, as well as nonclinical and clinical development of radiotracers and theranostics research. Their product portfolio includes several GE HealthCare radiopharmaceuticals. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.\\nACQUISITIONS.\\nMIM Software\\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company acquired \\n100\\n% of the stock of MIM Software Inc. (\\u0093MIM Software\\u0094) for approximately $\\n259\\n million, net of cash acquired of $\\n11\\n million, and potential contingent payments valued at $\\n13\\n\\u00a0million pertaining to achievement of certain milestones, for a total preliminary purchase price of $\\n283\\n million. The acquisition included up to $\\n23\\n\\u00a0million of other contingent payments based on service requirements. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $\\n194\\n million, customer-related intangible assets of $\\n52\\n\\u00a0million, developed technology intangible assets of $\\n48\\n\\u00a0million, net deferred tax liabilities of $\\n18\\n million, and other net assets of $\\n7\\n million. Purchase price allocations are based on preliminary valuations. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The goodwill associated with the acquired business, recorded within the Imaging segment, is non-deductible for tax purposes and is attributed to expected synergies and commercial benefits from use of the MIM Software technology in our existing GE HealthCare portfolio. MIM Software is a global provider of medical imaging analysis and artificial intelligence (\\u0093AI\\u0094) solutions for the practice of radiation oncology, molecular radiotherapy, diagnostic imaging, and urology at imaging centers, hospitals, specialty clinics, and research organizations worldwide. \\n81\\nRevenue and earnings of MIM Software included in the Company\\u0092s financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to our consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of MIM Software had taken place as of the beginning of 2023, consolidated revenues and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.\\nCaption Health\\nOn February 17, 2023, the Company acquired \\n100\\n% of the stock of Caption Health, Inc. (\\u0093Caption Health\\u0094) for $\\n127\\n million of upfront payment, $\\n10\\n million of future holdback payment, and potential earn-out payments valued at $\\n13\\n million based primarily on various milestones and sales targets. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $\\n94\\n million, intangible assets of $\\n60\\n million, and deferred tax liabilities of $\\n3\\n million. The purchase price allocation for Caption Health was finalized in the first quarter of 2024 without material adjustments. The goodwill associated with the acquired business is non-deductible for tax purposes and is reported in the AVS segment. Caption Health is an AI company whose technology expands access to AI-guided ultrasound screening for novice users.\\nGOODWILL.\\nAs discussed in Note 4, \\u0093Segment and Geographical Information\\u0094, effective in the third quarter of 2024, the Company (1) reorganized its operations and moved responsibility for and reporting of IGT from the Imaging segment to the Ultrasound Segment and (2) renamed the Ultrasound segment the AVS segment. This resulted in a $\\n1,031\\n million increase in the Company\\u0092s allocation of goodwill to its AVS segment and a corresponding decrease in the goodwill allocated to the Imaging segment. \\nThe Company allocated goodwill to its new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In connection with this change in reportable segments in the third quarter of 2024, the Company evaluated the goodwill of our Imaging and AVS reporting units for impairment before and after the segment realignment. There were \\nno\\n impairments identified as part of these assessments.\\nImaging\\nAVS\\nPCS\\nPDx\\nTotal\\nBalance at December 31, 2022\\n$\\n4,409\\n$\\n3,835\\n$\\n2,036\\n$\\n2,533\\n$\\n12,813\\nAcquisitions\\n(1)\\n16\\n94\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n110\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n6\\n4\\n2\\n1\\n13\\nBalance at December 31, 2023\\n4,431\\n3,933\\n2,038\\n2,534\\n12,936\\nReallocation\\n(\\n1,031\\n)\\n1,031\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nAcquisitions\\n(1)\\n194\\n42\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n236\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n(\\n13\\n)\\n(\\n19\\n)\\n(\\n3\\n)\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n(\\n36\\n)\\nBalance at December 31, 2024\\n$\\n3,581\\n$\\n4,987\\n$\\n2,035\\n$\\n2,533\\n$\\n13,136\\n(1) Includes the acquisition of Intelligent Ultrasound Group PLC in our AVS segment in the fourth quarter of 2024 and IMACTIS SAS in our Imaging segment in the second quarter of 2023.\\nThe Company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter. In 2024, the Company performed quantitative testing for all reporting units that carried goodwill. The quantitative testing conducted concluded that \\nno\\n goodwill impairments existed. In 2023, a qualitative assessment was performed. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no quantitative testing was required.\\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\\nAs of December 31, 2024\\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nGross Carrying Amount\\nAccumulated Amortization\\nNet\\nGross Carrying Amount\\nAccumulated Amortization\\nNet\\nDefinite-lived assets\\nCustomer-related\\n$\\n112\\n$\\n(\\n24\\n)\\n$\\n88\\n$\\n60\\n$\\n(\\n16\\n)\\n$\\n44\\nPatents and technology\\n2,593\\n(\\n1,987\\n)\\n606\\n2,541\\n(\\n1,867\\n)\\n674\\nCapitalized software \\n1,743\\n(\\n1,437\\n)\\n306\\n1,963\\n(\\n1,509\\n)\\n454\\nTrademarks and other\\n33\\n(\\n29\\n)\\n4\\n33\\n(\\n27\\n)\\n6\\nTotal definite-lived assets\\n4,481\\n(\\n3,477\\n)\\n1,004\\n4,597\\n(\\n3,419\\n)\\n1,178\\nIndefinite-lived assets\\n(1)\\n74\\n\\u0097\\n74\\n75\\n\\u0097\\n75\\nTotal other intangible assets\\n$\\n4,555\\n$\\n(\\n3,477\\n)\\n$\\n1,078\\n$\\n4,672\\n$\\n(\\n3,419\\n)\\n$\\n1,253\\n(1) Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to acquired IPR&D prior to project completion and are not amortized.\\n82\\nThe Company performs an impairment test of IPR&D in the third quarter.

This reflects the $\\n1,000\\n\\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of \\n4.800\\n% senior unsecured notes issued by the Company in the third quarter of 2024, and a repayment in the fourth quarter of 2024 of $\\n1,000\\n\\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of \\n5.550\\n% senior unsecured notes.\\nInterest payments on the Notes are due semi-annually until maturity. In the event of a change in control and a related downgrade of the ratings of the Notes below investment grade, the indenture governing the Notes requires that the Company make an offer to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part of that holder\\u0092s notes at a repurchase price equal to \\n101\\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture also includes a limitation on liens incurred by the Company and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. The indenture does not restrict the Company or its subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness, nor does it contain any financial covenants. All covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Refer to the table below for further information about the Notes.\\nCredit Facilities\\nThe Company has credit agreements providing for:\\n\\u0095\\na \\nfive-year\\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $\\n2,500\\n\\u00a0million, maturing on January 3, 2028; \\n\\u0095\\na \\n364-day\\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $\\n1,000\\n\\u00a0million, maturing on December 10, 2025; and\\n\\u0095\\na \\nthree-year\\n senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $\\n2,000\\n\\u00a0million, maturing on January 2, 2026 (the \\u0093Term Loan Facility\\u0094 and, together with the \\nfive-year\\n revolving credit facility and the \\n364-day\\n revolving credit facility, the \\u0093Credit Facilities\\u0094).\\nThere were \\nno\\n outstanding amounts under the \\nfive-year\\n revolving credit facility and \\n364-day\\n revolving credit facility, and there was $\\n750\\n\\u00a0million and $\\n1,150\\n\\u00a0million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the first and fourth quarters of 2024, we repaid $\\n150\\n\\u00a0million and $\\n250\\n\\u00a0million, respectively, of the Term Loan Facility. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into a new \\n364-day\\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility to replace the \\n364-day\\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matured in December 2024.\\nThe Company pays a facility fee to each lender, which accrues at a rate equal to an applicable margin specified in the revolving credit facility agreements on the daily commitments of the lenders. The borrowings under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable interest rates equal to: (1) the alternate base rate or (2) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin specified in the credit agreement. The Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants customary to financings of this type that limit, among other things, the Company\\u0092s ability to incur additional liens and to enter into certain fundamental change transactions and the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company\\u0092s subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant that requires the Company to not exceed a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at each reporting period during 2024.

Additionally, we have issued approximately $\\n25\\n million and $\\n39\\n million of guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to residual value and credit guarantees on equipment sold to third-party finance companies. Our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflect a liability of $\\n3\\n million and $\\n4\\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these guarantees. For credit-related guarantees, we estimate our expected credit losses related to off-balance sheet credit exposure consistent with the method used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost.

These plans were accounted for as multiemployer plans prior to the Spin-Off. Certain \\nof these benefit plans are closed to new participants. For the year ended December 31, 2022, relevant costs for these plans were allocated to the Company by GE and recognized within the Combined Statements of Income. These costs included service costs for active employees in the U.S. GE Pension Plan, certain international pension plans, the U.S. GE Supplementary Pension Plan, and certain U.S. retiree benefit plans. \\nExpenses associated with our employees\\u0092 participation in the U.S. GE Pension Plan and certain U.S. retiree benefit plans, which represent the majority of related expense, were $\\n73\\n\\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Expenses associated with our employees\\u0092 participation in certain international pension plans were $\\n11\\n\\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \\n84\\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS POST SPIN-OFF. \\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, on January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare assumed a portion of former GE pension and other postretirement obligations and assets. The pension and other postretirement obligations assumed relate to benefits owed to current GE HealthCare employees, former GE HealthCare employees, and certain GE legacy plan participants. As of January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare established the assumed pension plans as single-employer plans, but continued to participate in legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans sponsored by GE.\\n On January 1, 2024, we transitioned from the legacy GE multiple-employer other postretirement benefit (\\u0093OPEB\\u0094) plans to a GE HealthCare sponsored single-employer OPEB plan. This change did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.\\nThe total assets and liabilities for all plans assumed by GE HealthCare on January 1, 2023, are shown in the tables below.\\nAccumulated Benefit Obligations and Unrecognized Gain\\nAs of January 1, 2023\\nDefined benefit plans\\n(1)\\nOther postretirement plans\\n(2)\\nTotal\\nAccumulated benefit obligations\\n$\\n21,696\\n$\\n1,210\\n$\\n22,906\\nUnrecognized gain recorded in AOCI\\n1,258\\n1,223\\n2,481\\nNet Benefit Liability\\nAs of January 1, 2023\\nDefined benefit plans\\n(1)\\nOther postretirement plans\\n(2)\\nTotal\\nProjected benefit obligations\\n$\\n21,743\\n$\\n1,210\\n$\\n22,953\\nFair value of plan assets\\n18,908\\n\\u0097\\n18,908\\nNet liability\\n$\\n2,835\\n$\\n1,210\\n$\\n4,045\\n(1) Defined benefit plans are comprised of both U.S. Plans and International Plans, as described below.\\n(2) OPEB Plans are comprised of benefits, as described below.\\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR PLANS.\\nAs a result of the liabilities and assets transferred to GE HealthCare on January 1, 2023, we disclose in the following tables postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $\\n50\\n\\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we disclose postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $\\n20\\n\\u00a0million in the following tables. We use a December 31st measurement date for these plans and all tables presented below are for the years ended December 31st.\\nThe U.S. Pension Plans are comprised of the obligations transferred to GE HealthCare from GE in connection with the Spin-Off and obligations that existed prior to the Spin-Off. The largest plans include the GE HealthCare Pension Plan and the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan, which provides supplementary benefits to higher-level, longer-service U.S. employees. The GE HealthCare Pension Plan and the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan have been closed to new participants since 2012. All remaining service accruals for the GE HealthCare Pension Plan were frozen effective December 31, 2024. Benefits for participants of the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan who became executives before 2011 were frozen effective January 1, 2021, and thereafter these employees accrue a benefit which is paid out in \\nten\\n annual installments upon retirement. The GE HealthCare Pension Plan has a projected benefit obligation of $\\n15,230\\n\\u00a0million, plan assets of $\\n13,650\\n\\u00a0million, and is \\n90\\n% funded per U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2024. The GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension plan has a projected benefit obligation of $\\n1,886\\n\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2024, and the benefits are paid to eligible participants directly by the Company as described further in \\u0093Funding\\u0094 below. \\nOur International Pension Plans include all other plans that cover non-U.S. participants. These plans include obligations that existed prior to the Spin-Off and obligations transferred to GE HealthCare from GE in connection with the Spin-Off. In certain countries, benefit accruals have ceased and/or have been closed to new hires as of various dates.\\nThe OPEB Plans include unfunded postretirement health and life insurance defined benefit obligations to U.S. participants. GE HealthCare assumed the obligations associated with these plans in connection with the Spin-Off. Participants share in the cost of the healthcare and life insurance benefits. With the exception of production employees, subsidized benefits are generally only available to closed groups of employees and retirees.\\nFunding\\nThe Company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount for our qualified plans. Non-qualified plans are unfunded and we pay benefits from our cash on hand. In 2025, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $\\n327\\n\\u00a0million to these plans.\\n85\\nPlan Funded Status\\nU.S. Plans\\nInternational Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\n2024\\n2023\\n2024\\n2023\\n2024\\n2023\\nChange in projected benefit obligations\\nBalance at January 1\\n$\\n19,363\\n$\\n297\\n$\\n3,385\\n$\\n343\\n$\\n1,133\\n$\\n\\u0097\\nTransfers from GE at Spin-Off\\n\\u0097\\n18,999\\n\\u0097\\n2,705\\n\\u0097\\n1,149\\nService cost\\n35\\n35\\n20\\n20\\n7\\n6\\nInterest cost\\n970\\n1,022\\n141\\n139\\n54\\n59\\nParticipant contributions\\n4\\n4\\n\\u0097\\n1\\n16\\n18\\nPlan amendments\\n\\u0097\\n53\\n\\u0097\\n2\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nActuarial loss (gain) \\u0096 net\\n(\\n799\\n)\\n553\\n(\\n357\\n)\\n161\\n(\\n48\\n)\\n50\\nBenefits paid\\n(\\n1,332\\n)\\n(\\n1,570\\n)\\n(\\n131\\n)\\n(\\n130\\n)\\n(\\n146\\n)\\n(\\n149\\n)\\nCurtailments\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n30\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nSettlements\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n4\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nExchange rate adjustments\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n96\\n)\\n144\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nBalance at December 31\\n$\\n18,241\\n$\\n19,363\\n$\\n2,957\\n$\\n3,385\\n$\\n1,016\\n$\\n1,133\\nChange in plan assets\\nBalance at January 1\\n$\\n15,485\\n$\\n362\\n$\\n3,733\\n$\\n20\\n$\\n\\u0097\\n$\\n\\u0097\\nTransfers from GE at Spin-Off\\n\\u0097\\n15,402\\n\\u0097\\n3,482\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nActual gain (loss) on plan assets\\n49\\n1,101\\n(\\n263\\n)\\n145\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nEmployer contributions\\n172\\n186\\n30\\n40\\n130\\n131\\nParticipant contributions\\n4\\n4\\n\\u0097\\n1\\n16\\n18\\nBenefits paid\\n(\\n1,332\\n)\\n(\\n1,570\\n)\\n(\\n136\\n)\\n(\\n130\\n)\\n(\\n146\\n)\\n(\\n149\\n)\\nAcquisitions/Divestitures/Mergers\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n1\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nExchange rate adjustments\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n89\\n)\\n174\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\nBalance at December 31\\n$\\n14,378\\n$\\n15,485\\n$\\n3,276\\n$\\n3,733\\n$\\n\\u0097\\n$\\n\\u0097\\nFunded status \\u0096 surplus (deficit)\\n$\\n(\\n3,863\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n3,878\\n)\\n$\\n319\\n$\\n348\\n$\\n(\\n1,016\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n1,133\\n)\\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions (such as changes in the discount rate and revised mortality rates).

As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax curtailment loss of approximately $\\n17\\n\\u00a0million as non-operating benefit costs and an increase to our pension liability of $\\n23\\n\\u00a0million in 2023. As a result of the plan changes, we remeasured the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. These changes collectively decreased AOCI by $\\n305\\n\\u00a0million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. \\n87\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, management approved and paid a one-time lump sum payment for certain terminated employees in \\ntwo\\n plans who were vested in their benefits. These lump sum settlements reduce our future cash requirements. As a result of the partial settlement of the pension liability, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge in 2023. The settlement charge of $\\n61\\n million represents a pro rata portion of unrecognized net loss recorded in AOCI and is recorded in Non-operating benefit (income) costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\nAssumptions\\nU.S. Plans\\nInternational Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\n2024\\n2023\\nWeighted-average benefit obligations assumptions\\nDiscount rate\\n5.7\\n%\\n5.2\\n%\\n5.5\\n%\\n4.9\\n%\\n4.2\\n%\\n3.3\\n%\\n5.5\\n%\\n5.1\\n%\\nCompensation increases\\n3.5\\n%\\n3.7\\n%\\n\\u0097\\n%\\n2.8\\n%\\n3.1\\n%\\n3.0\\n%\\n3.6\\n%\\n3.6\\n%\\nWeighted-average benefit cost assumptions\\nDiscount rate\\n5.2\\n%\\n5.5\\n%\\n3.0\\n%\\n4.2\\n%\\n4.6\\n%\\n1.2\\n%\\n5.1\\n%\\n5.4\\n%\\nExpected rate of return on plan assets\\n7.0\\n%\\n7.0\\n%\\n7.0\\n%\\n5.3\\n%\\n5.2\\n%\\n2.4\\n%\\n\\u0097\\n%\\n\\u0097\\n%\\nFor the December 31, 2024 postretirement health care obligations remeasurement, the Company assumed a \\n8.0\\n% initial weighted average rate of increase in the per capita cost of the various covered health care benefits, which applies primarily to non-Medicare eligible participants. The trend rate was assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of \\n4.5\\n% in 2036 and remain at that level thereafter.\\nAssumptions Used in Calculations \\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement, and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in today\\u0092s U.S. dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments are expected to be made. We also assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.\\nGE HealthCare engages third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of the pension and other postretirement defined benefit plan assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions, such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and update them as necessary to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future.\\nWe determine the discount rate using the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities that have maturities consistent with the expected timing of benefit payments. \\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future.\\nThe compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which compensation of active plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and amortized to earnings in subsequent periods. \\nExpected Future Benefit Payments of Our Benefit Plans\\nU.S. Plans\\nInternational Plans\\nOPEB Plans\\n2025\\n$\\n1,377\\n$\\n134\\n$\\n135\\n2026\\n1,391\\n140\\n132\\n2027\\n1,396\\n142\\n129\\n2028\\n1,400\\n154\\n125\\n2029\\n1,400\\n159\\n121\\n2030-2034\\n6,827\\n880\\n487\\n88\\nPENSION PLAN ASSETS.\\nThe GE HealthCare Employee Benefits Investment Committee (the \\u0093Investment Committee\\u0094) and various country pension boards oversee and monitor the investment decisions related to the assets of our U.S. funded pension plans and other international pension assets, respectively. The Investment Committee retains independent investment managers and advisors and uses documented policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, the funded status of the plans, and other relevant factors and considerations.\\nThe assets of our U.S. funded pension plans are invested in a portfolio that includes U.S. and international equity securities; U.S. government and corporate debt securities; asset-backed debt securities; private equity; real estate and other alternative investments; as well as cash and cash equivalents and derivatives contracts. This combination of assets and derivatives is utilized to implement the investment strategies as well as for hedging asset and liability risks.

Significant judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and the amount of such valuation allowance. In assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024, we considered all available evidence, including the nature of financial statement losses, reversing taxable temporary differences, estimated future operating profits, and tax planning actions and strategies.\\n91\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nTotal assets\\n$\\n4,474\\n$\\n4,474\\nTotal liabilities\\n(\\n56\\n)\\n(\\n68\\n)\\nNet deferred income tax asset (liability)\\n$\\n4,418\\n$\\n4,406\\nComponents of the Net Deferred Income Tax Asset (Liability)\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nEmployee benefits\\n$\\n1,340\\n$\\n1,418\\nReserves and accruals\\n413\\n458\\nOperating loss carryforwards\\n447\\n648\\nLease liabilities\\n57\\n75\\nTax credit carryforwards\\n80\\n59\\nU.S. interest restriction carryforwards\\n156\\n61\\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\\n1,355\\n1,461\\nProperty, plant, and equipment\\n223\\n261\\nCapitalized R&D\\n689\\n547\\nOther deferred tax assets\\n55\\n111\\nTotal deferred income tax asset\\n4,817\\n5,099\\nValuation allowances\\n(\\n231\\n)\\n(\\n540\\n)\\nTotal deferred income tax asset after valuation allowance\\n4,586\\n4,559\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nROU assets\\n(\\n42\\n)\\n(\\n50\\n)\\nOther deferred tax liabilities\\n(\\n126\\n)\\n(\\n102\\n)\\nTotal deferred income tax liability\\n(\\n168\\n)\\n(\\n152\\n)\\nNet deferred income tax asset (liability)\\n$\\n4,418\\n$\\n4,406\\nThe deferred tax asset associated with capitalized R&D is related to U.S. tax law that requires capitalization and amortization over five or fifteen years. In the event the capitalization of research costs is adjusted through retroactive legislation effective for 2022, the Company expects to record a reduction to the 2022 deferred tax asset resulting in a charge to tax expense under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE in the amount of $\\n228\\n million.\\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, our net deferred income tax assets inc\\nreased in 2023 by $\\n3,099\\n million primarily due to transfers from GE, including $\\n964\\n million related to pension and postretirement benefits, with the remainder primarily attributable to tax attributes that were not part of the Company\\u0092s stand-alone operations, and changes to valuation on a GE HealthCare basis.\\nValuation allowances primarily relate to non-U.S. deferred taxes where there were historical losses and U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards. \\nActivity in the valuation allowance consists of the following: \\nValuation Allowances\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n540\\n$\\n272\\n$\\n279\\nProvision for income taxes\\n(\\n279\\n)\\n(\\n12\\n)\\n(\\n5\\n)\\nForeign currency exchange and other\\n(\\n31\\n)\\n280\\n(\\n2\\n)\\nBalance at end of period \\n$\\n231\\n$\\n540\\n$\\n272\\nAs a result of the Spin-Off, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $\\n269\\n\\u00a0million in 2023, which is included in the Foreign currency exchange and other line of the table above. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our valuation allowance decreased by $\\n310\\n million, which included a release of a valuation allowance in France of $\\n295\\n million reflected in the Provision for income taxes line. Based on our analysis of all positive and negative evidence during the year ended December 31, 2024, we concluded that it is more likely than not that France deferred tax assets will be realizable based on our profitability in France as a stand-alone company post Spin-Off and our expectation for the continued generation of prospective positive income in the jurisdiction. In making these judgments, we considered various business and structural factors as a stand-alone company, which support our conclusion of the realization of the deferred tax assets.\\n92\\nNET OPERATING LOSSES.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $\\n5,978\\n\\u00a0million primarily related to France, Ireland, Brazil, Germany, and the Netherlands, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The gross net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a deferred tax asset of $\\n1,133\\n\\u00a0million as of December 31, 2024. This amount excludes accruals of $\\n266\\n\\u00a0million for unrecognized tax benefits the Company has recorded related to the underlying tax positions which generated the net operating losses and expected impacts to U.S. foreign tax credits of $\\n420\\n\\u00a0million. \\nUNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS.\\nPost Spin-Off, the Company\\u0092s previously undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are no longer indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. businesses due to current U.S. funding needs. Therefore, in 2023, an incremental deferred tax liability of $\\n21\\n million was recorded for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. In addition, the Company is providing for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of current period earnings. However, the Company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon an unforeseen future reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution or disposition to an unrelated third party) of approximately $\\n8\\n\\u00a0billion to be permanent in duration. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable.\\nNOTE 12. \\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) \\u0096 NET\\nChanges in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \\u0096 net by component were as follows.\\nCurrency translation adjustments\\n(1)\\nPension and Other Postretirement Plans\\nCash flow hedges\\nTotal AOCI\\nDecember 31, 2021\\n$\\n(\\n969\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n100\\n)\\n$\\n32\\n$\\n(\\n1,037\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \\u0096 net of taxes of $(\\n5\\n), $(\\n39\\n), and $(\\n10\\n)\\n(\\n878\\n)\\n58\\n27\\n(\\n793\\n)\\nReclassifications from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n\\u0097\\n, $\\n\\u0097\\n, and $\\n17\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n50\\n)\\n(\\n50\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n(\\n878\\n)\\n58\\n(\\n23\\n)\\n(\\n843\\n)\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n(\\n2\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n2\\n)\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n(\\n1,845\\n)\\n(\\n42\\n)\\n9\\n(\\n1,878\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\\n(3)\\n \\u0096 net of taxes of $\\n22\\n, $\\n186\\n, and $\\n1\\n74\\n(\\n601\\n)\\n(\\n5\\n)\\n(\\n532\\n)\\nReclassifications from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n\\u0097\\n, $\\n97\\n, and $\\n6\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n296\\n)\\n(\\n22\\n)\\n(\\n318\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n74\\n(\\n897\\n)\\n(\\n27\\n)\\n(\\n850\\n)\\nSpin-Off related adjustments \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(4)\\n of $\\n\\u0097\\n $(\\n509\\n), and $\\n\\u0097\\n28\\n1,972\\n\\u0097\\n2,000\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n(\\n37\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n37\\n)\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n(\\n1,706\\n)\\n1,033\\n(\\n18\\n)\\n(\\n691\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \\u0096 net of taxes of $(\\n19\\n), $\\n93\\n, and $(\\n11\\n)\\n(\\n271\\n)\\n(\\n306\\n)\\n33\\n(\\n545\\n)\\nReclassifications from AOCI \\u0096 net of taxes\\n(2)\\n of $\\n\\u0097\\n, $\\n44\\n, and $(\\n1\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n150\\n)\\n3\\n(\\n147\\n)\\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\\n(\\n271\\n)\\n(\\n456\\n)\\n36\\n(\\n691\\n)\\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n(\\n4\\n)\\n\\u0097\\n\\u0097\\n(\\n4\\n)\\nDecember 31, 2024\\n$\\n(\\n1,973\\n)\\n$\\n576\\n$\\n18\\n$\\n(\\n1,379\\n)\\n(1) The amount of CTA recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) (\\u0093OCI\\u0094) included net gains (losses) relating to net investment hedges, as further discussed in Note 13, \\n\\u0093\\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\\u0094\\n(2) Reclassifications from AOCI into earnings for Pension and Other Postretirement Plans are recognized within Non-operating benefit (income) costs, while Cash flow hedges are recognized within Cost of products and Cost of services in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\n(3) Includes pre-tax impact to Pension and Other Postretirement Plans of $(\\n305\\n)\\u00a0million for the pension plan amendment and related remeasurement of plan assets and benefit obligations.

These derivative contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the aforementioned risks. Our policy is to use derivative contracts solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes.\\nThe fair values of derivative contracts are recognized within All other current assets, All other non-current assets, All other current liabilities, and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the contractual timing of settlements for these contracts. We designate certain derivative contracts as hedging instruments in cash flow, fair value, or net investment hedges. We evaluate the effectiveness of our derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments on a quarterly basis.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the volatility of cash flows related to firm commitments and forecasted transactions, including intercompany transactions, denominated in foreign currencies other than a subsidiary\\u0092s functional currency. The maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is \\ntwo years\\n. As of December 31, 2024, these contracts have a maximum remaining maturity of \\n15\\n months.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash\\nflow hedges, changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and to the same financial statement line item impacted by the hedged transaction. As of December 31, 2024, we expect to reclassify $\\n22\\n\\u00a0million of pre-tax net deferred gain associated with designated cash flow hedges to earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the impact on earnings of the related hedged transactions.\\nThe cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in All other operating activities \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe use cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts in combination with foreign currency option contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2024, these contracts were designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily in Euro and Chinese Renminbi currencies.\\nWe use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency to USD spot exchange rates are initially recorded and held as a component of the CTA portion of AOCI until the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated. Changes in fair value of the portion of net investment hedging derivatives excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in CTA and then recognized within Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedge. Excluded components on the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges, in the form of accrued interest, are recorded within Interest and other financial charges \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.\\nThe cash flows associated with derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded in All other investing activities \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2024, All other investing activities \\u0096 net includes a $\\n94\\n\\u00a0million payment for the settlement of cross-currency swaps that were designated in net investment hedges. Cash flows from the periodic interest settlements on the cross-currency swaps are recorded in All other operating activities \\u0096 net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on our fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rate risk of specific designated cash flows of our senior unsecured notes.

Under the terms of this agreement, in return for providing development activities associated with the development of the underlying ultrasound device to deliver Novo\\u0092s clinical therapies, we received an upfront nonrefundable payment with the potential for additional nonrefundable payments through 2027. We recognize the nonrefundable payments as an offset to R&D expense as we perform activities contemplated under this agreement. These nonrefundable payments are not material. We may also receive future payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones and regulatory approvals associated with the ultrasound therapy.\\nREDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\\n.\\nThe Company has noncontrolling interests with redemption features. These redemption features, such as put options, could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the occurrence of certain events. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position between liabilities and equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are initially recorded at the issuance date fair value. Those that are currently redeemable, or probable of becoming redeemable, are subsequently adjusted to the greater of current redemption value or initial carrying value. \\nActivity attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is presented below.\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n165\\n$\\n230\\n$\\n220\\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\\n50\\n41\\n47\\nRedemption value adjustments\\n(1)\\n\\u0097\\n183\\n\\u0097\\nDistributions to and exercise of redeemable noncontrolling interests and other\\n(2)\\n(\\n28\\n)\\n(\\n289\\n)\\n(\\n37\\n)\\nBalance at end of period \\n$\\n188\\n$\\n165\\n$\\n230\\n(1) As of January 3, 2023, certain redeemable noncontrolling interests were probable of becoming redeemable due to the change of control that occurred upon consummation of the Spin-Off. As a result, these redeemable noncontrolling interests were remeasured to their current redemption value. The remeasurement was accounted for as a deemed preferred stock dividend of redeemable noncontrolling interest and recorded as an adjustment to Retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\\n(2) In the first quarter of 2023, the redeemable noncontrolling interest holder exercised its option redemption provision. The redemption amount of $\\n211\\n million was paid in the second quarter of 2023.\\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) \\n\\u0096\\n NET.\\nFor the years ended December 31\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nNet financing income and investment income (loss)\\n$\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n$\\n26\\n$\\n(\\n9\\n)\\nEquity method income (loss)\\n8\\n11\\n13\\nChange in fair value of assumed obligations\\n(\\n32\\n)\\n(\\n32\\n)\\n\\u0097\\nOther items, net\\n(1)\\n80\\n81\\n58\\nTotal other income (expense) \\u0096 net\\n$\\n55\\n$\\n86\\n$\\n62\\n(1) Other items, net primarily consists of: change in tax indemnity, lease income, government grants, licensing and royalty income, and gains and losses related to derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2024; change in tax indemnity, lease income, licensing and royalty income, and gains and losses related to derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2023; and gains and losses related to derivatives and licensing and royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nNOTE 19. \\nRELATED PARTIES AND TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT\\nPRIOR TO SPIN-OFF.\\nPrior to the Spin-Off, GE provided the Company with significant corporate infrastructure and shared services. The following disclosures summarize related party activity between GE HealthCare and GE. This activity, which occurred prior to the Spin-Off, is included in the combined financial statements.\\n106\\nPension, Benefit, and Contribution Plans\\nAs discussed in Note 10, \\u0093Postretirement Benefit Plans\\u0094, employees of the Company participated in pension, benefit, and contribution plans that were sponsored by GE. The Company was charged $\\n207\\n\\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to employee participation in these plans. In connection with the Spin-Off, a portion of the plans were transferred to the Company.\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nGE granted various employee benefits to its group employees, including those of the Company, under the GE Long-Term Incentive Plan. These benefits primarily included stock options and RSUs. Compensation expense allocated to the Company was $\\n67\\n\\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and was primarily recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statement of Income. \\nCorporate Overhead and Other Allocations from GE\\nGE provided certain services described below that were charged to the Company based on employee headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies.\\nFor the year ended December 31\\n2022\\nCosts for centralized services\\n(1)\\n$\\n42\\nCosts associated with employee medical insurance\\n(2)\\n122\\nCosts for corporate and shared services\\n(3)\\n457\\n(1) Costs for centralized services such as public relations, treasury and cash management, and other services were recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statement of Income.\\n(2) Costs associated with employee medical insurance were recognized within Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and R&D in the Combined Statement of Income based on the employee population.\\n(3) Costs for corporate and shared services such as information technology, finance and other services were primarily recognized in SG&A and R&D in the Combined Statement of Income.\\nManagement believes that the expense and cost allocations have been determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. The amounts that would have been incurred on a stand-alone basis could have materially differed from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more or fewer employees, or other factors.\\nAFTER SPIN-OFF.\\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into or adopted several agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and GE. These agreements were structured in anticipation of GE\\u0092s transaction to separate the GE Vernova business. Refer to Note 1, \\u0093Organization and Basis of Presentation\\u0094 for additional information. The below agreements had activity during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\\n\\u0095\\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement \\n\\u0096 sets forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off, including the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities, and establishes certain rights and obligations between the Company and GE following the Distribution, including procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.\\n\\u0095\\nTransition Services Agreement \\n\\u0096 governs all matters relating to the provision of shared services between the Company and GE on a transitional basis. The services the Company receives include support for information technology, human resources, supply chain, finance, and facilities services, among others. Some of these costs were included in the allocations from GE prior to Spin-Off. The services generally commenced on the date of the Spin-Off and terminated in the \\n24\\n months following the Distribution Date depending upon the related transitional service. We incurred $\\n172\\n\\u00a0million, n\\net, and $\\n372\\n\\u00a0million, net, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under this agreement. These amounts represent fees charged from GE and GE Vernova to the Company, the majority of which are related to information technology, and are net of fees charged from the Company to GE and GE Vernova for facilities and other shared services. \\n\\u0095\\nTax Matters Agreement \\n\\u0096 governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between the Company and GE with respect to all tax matters (excluding employee-related taxes covered under the Employee Matters Agreement), in addition to certain restrictions which generally prohibit us from taking or failing to take any action in the \\ntwo-year\\n period following the Distribution that would prevent the Distribution from qualifying as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including limitations on our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion of tax liability for which the Company will bear contractual responsibility, and the Company and GE will each agree to indemnify each other against any amounts for which such indemnified party is not responsible.\\n107\\nCurrent amounts due from and to GE under the various agreements are recognized within Due from related parties or Due to related parties, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Non-current amounts due from GE were $\\n99\\n\\u00a0million and $\\n81\\n million, and due to GE were $\\n34\\n million and $\\n33\\n million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were recognized within All other non-current assets and All other non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and relate to tax and other indemnities. Following its separation from GE, GE Vernova does not meet the definition of a related party; accordingly, amounts as of December 31, 2024 due to and from GE Vernova in accordance with the TSA are excluded from the Due from related parties and Due to related parties financial statement line items and non-current balances disclosed above.\\nNOTE 20. \\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\\nOn February 3, 2025, we repaid $\\n250\\n million of the outstanding Term Loan Facility.\\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\u0092s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\\u0092s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, and that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\\u0092s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nMANAGEMENT\\u0092S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\\nThe Company\\u0092s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control \\u0096 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that they were effective as of December 31, 2024. All internal control systems have inherent limitations; as such, they may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements preparation and reporting. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the current control structure may become inadequate for changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.\\nThe effectiveness of such controls has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8, \\u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\u0094 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company continued to exit from various transition service agreements with GE, primarily related to IT systems that impact financial reporting. Consequently, responsibility for execution of related internal controls transferred to the Company, including general IT controls in connection with IT environment changes. Other than those discussed in the preceding sentences, there were no changes in the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company\\u0092s internal control over financial reporting.\\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\\nDIRECTOR AND OFFICER TRADING ARRANGEMENTS.\\nNone of our directors or executive officers \\nadopted\\n or \\nterminated\\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during the quarterly period covered by this report.\\nITEM 9C.

        "## 7. Summary and Conclusion 📝\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the baseline and fine-tuned model evaluations, we can summarize the findings and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of fine-tuning GPT-2 with SFTTrainer on this financial Q&A dataset and the impact of the implemented guardrail.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation results:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Baseline Model:** The baseline GPT-2 model, without fine-tuning on this specific dataset, performed poorly on the financial Q&A task, often providing irrelevant or incomplete answers with low confidence scores. This highlights the need for domain-specific fine-tuning.\n",
        "*   **Fine-Tuned Model:** The fine-tuned GPT-2 model with SFTTrainer shows significant improvement. It is able to provide relevant answers to financial questions from the dataset with higher confidence scores. While not perfect (some answers may still contain inaccuracies or require further refinement), it demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised instruction fine-tuning for this task.\n",
        "*   **RAG Model:** The RAG approach leverages retrieval from the source data, providing answers that are more factually grounded and adaptable to new information. RAG is robust to out-of-domain queries due to its retrieval component, but may be slower due to the retrieval and reranking steps.\n",
        "*   **Guardrail:** The implemented guardrail successfully identified and flagged irrelevant questions (e.g., \"What is the company's stock ticker?\" and \"Who is the CEO of the company?\"), returning a \"Not applicable\" response with high confidence. This is crucial for ensuring the model stays within its intended domain and doesn't provide misleading information for out-of-scope queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison of Average Inference Speed and Accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inference Speed:** Fine-tuned models are generally faster at inference since they generate answers directly, while RAG models require retrieval and reranking, which adds latency. In our results, the fine-tuned model consistently produced answers more quickly than RAG.\n",
        "- **Accuracy:** RAG models tend to be more accurate for fact-based questions, as they ground their answers in retrieved context. Fine-tuned models may be more fluent but can hallucinate or provide less factual answers if the training data is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths of Each Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **RAG Strengths:**\n",
        "    - Adaptability to new data without retraining.\n",
        "    - Factual grounding from source documents.\n",
        "    - Robustness to irrelevant queries due to retrieval and guardrail logic.\n",
        "- **Fine-Tuning Strengths:**\n",
        "    - Fluency and natural language generation.\n",
        "    - Efficiency in inference speed.\n",
        "    - Can generalize well within the domain if trained on sufficient data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Robustness to Irrelevant Queries\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches benefit from the guardrail logic, but RAG is inherently more robust due to its reliance on retrieval. Fine-tuned models may attempt to answer any question, but with a guardrail, they can gracefully handle out-of-domain queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Trade-Offs\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **RAG:** Best for scenarios where factual accuracy and adaptability to new data are critical, but with higher computational cost and slower inference.\n",
        "- **Fine-Tuning:** Preferred for applications requiring fast, fluent responses within a well-defined domain, but may require frequent retraining to stay up-to-date.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like GPT-2 on a domain-specific dataset using SFTTrainer is an effective approach for building a question-answering system for that domain. The addition of a simple guardrail significantly improves the system's robustness by handling irrelevant queries gracefully. RAG offers superior factual accuracy and adaptability, while fine-tuning excels in speed and fluency. The choice between these approaches depends on the application's requirements for accuracy, speed, and domain coverage. Further improvements could involve expanding the training dataset, experimenting with different model architectures, or implementing more sophisticated guardrail mechanisms."
