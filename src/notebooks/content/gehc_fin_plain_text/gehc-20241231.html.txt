PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare, the Company, our, or we) is a trusted partner and leading global healthcare solutions provider, innovating medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and integrated, cloud-first AI-enabled solutions, services, and data analytics. We have approximately 53,000 colleagues dedicated to our mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits. We operate at the center of the healthcare ecosystem, enabling precision care by increasing health system capacity, enhancing productivity, digitizing healthcare delivery, and improving clinical outcomes while serving patients demand for greater efficiency, access, and personalized medicine. Our products, services, and solutions are designed to enable clinicians to make more informed decisions quickly and efficiently, improving patient care from screening and diagnosis to therapy and monitoring. We have more than 125 years of experience and one of the strongest reputations in the global healthcare industry, built from our demonstrated record of delivering industry-defining innovation. This is complemented by our broad service capabilities and dedication to quality and integrity with a strong operational culture, deeply embedded in lean continuous improvement.
Precision care is expected to drive continued demand and the need for novel technologies and future innovation, as healthcare providers and researchers seek new solutions and tools for managing various disease states. The pursuit of precision care opportunities significantly expands our addressable markets to include integrated diagnostics, AI and machine learning-based clinical decision support, highly personalized therapies enabled by more precise diagnostics, and remote patient monitoring. The scale and breadth of our portfolio, combined with our innovation capabilities, position us to be a leading enabler of precision care.
We generate revenue from the sale of medical devices, consumable products, service capabilities, and digital solutions. We serve customers in over 160 countries with a global team of approximately 9,800 sales professionals and 8,300 field service engineers. 
Our customers are healthcare providers and researchers, including public, private, and academic institutions. We are organized into four business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Imaging, Advanced Visualization Solutions (AVS), Patient Care Solutions (PCS), and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx). Our portfolio of solutions addresses the biggest challenges facing healthcare providers and patients today, and helps drive better patient outcomes and improved productivity for customers. These qualities foster trust, loyalty, and partnership with our global customer base. 
Our revenues and operating profits vary from quarter to quarter. Financial results in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than in other quarters due to the spending patterns of our customers.
GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. is a Delaware corporation with
 corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. On January 3, 2023, the General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (GE), completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare (the Spin-Off). Refer to Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation for further information regarding the Spin-Off.
OUR SEGMENTS
We develop, manufacture, and market a broad portfolio of products, services, and complementary digital solutions used in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients. We have a large, global installed base of medical imaging, ultrasound, and patient monitoring systems.
Effective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies (IGT), previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment to better match its clinical usage and realize stronger business and customer impact by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions. Following this realignment, the Company continues to have four reportable segments: Imaging, AVS, PCS, and PDx, as described below.
IMAGING.
GE HealthCare is a global leader in medical imaging with a comprehensive portfolio of scanning devices, clinical applications, service capabilities, and digital solutions. Our Imaging portfolio spans the care continuum and provides critical tools for clinicians, from initial screening and diagnosis, through therapeutic decision-making and monitoring of patient progression. Our products support providers in the delivery of care for a broad spectrum of clinical specialties, including oncology, cardiology, neurology, nuclear medicine, orthopedics, womens health, pediatrics, and surgery.
Our Imaging portfolio includes five product lines and associated service capabilities: Molecular Imaging (MI), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR), Womens Health, and X-ray. We manage our Molecular Imaging and Computed Tomography product lines together (MI/CT) and our Womens Health and X-ray product lines together (WH/XR).

Molecular imaging enables the visualization, characterization, and quantification of functional processes taking place at the cellular and subcellular levels within patients. The images produced by MI systems allow clinicians to study the cellular and molecular pathways and mechanisms of disease in patients. We offer a complete MI solution from cyclotrons, chemistry synthesis, positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (PET/CT), PET/MR, and nuclear medicine to advanced digital and AI-enabled solutions. Our Molecular Imaging team works closely with the PDx segment and their innovations and collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.
4

Computed tomography scans render 3D anatomical images of structures, such as bone, soft tissue, and air cavities using an X-ray tube that rotates around a patient. The images are used in a wide variety of applications, including the detection of tumors or lesions, blocked blood vessels in the brain, abnormal heart conditions, complex bone fractures, and internal injuries from trauma. Our comprehensive Computed Tomography portfolio includes multi-purpose and specialty scanners.

Magnetic resonance is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces detailed anatomical images of almost every internal structure in the human body, such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, breast, kidneys, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. MR can also be used for functional imaging, and it is well-suited for disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of a variety of conditions, including stroke, cancer, trauma, aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and congenital disorders. Our Magnetic Resonance portfolio includes scanners for a range of clinical capabilities through different bore sizes, magnetic field strengths, and scalable platforms.

Womens Health products use X-ray technology to help clinicians screen for and diagnose breast cancer as well as bone and metabolic diseases in women. The product portfolio includes imaging and biopsy positioning systems designed to image the breast and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanners designed to image bones with low mineral density.

X-ray systems are used by clinicians to perform first-line diagnostic imaging examinations of anatomical structures in the body, such as bones, lungs, and the gastrointestinal tract. Our X-ray product portfolio includes systems for three distinct clinical situations: fixed room radiography products installed in hospitals and imaging centers; mobile radiography products used for bedside or other point-of-care imaging needs; and fluoroscopy products installed in hospitals for dynamic or moving X-ray imaging in applications like gastrointestinal examinations.
We also offer a suite of AI-enabled software and applications that help clinicians improve productivity, address staff shortages, and deliver better patient outcomes. These software solutions and applications are upgradable through the lifecycle of the equipment and are especially beneficial for multi-site, multi-disciplinary networks that have complex operations. We also offer Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Radiological Information Systems to manage the storage and reporting of radiology images.
In addition to our core products, digital solutions, and service offerings, we provide complementary enterprise solutions, such as education and training and data integration services. Our broad enterprise solutions used along the imaging continuum enable us to drive connectivity across healthcare systems and throughout the product lifecycle.
ADVANCED VISUALIZATION SOLUTIONS.
GE HealthCare is a global leader in ultrasound, image guided therapies, and interventional solutions with a broad portfolio that spans the continuum of care, including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of certain diseases.

PHARMACEUTICAL DIAGNOSTICS.
GE HealthCare is a leading supplier of contrast and radiopharmaceutical imaging agents to the global radiology and nuclear medicine industries. These agents help clinicians assess patients to enable more precise diagnoses, monitor disease progression, and enable better therapy selection. We distribute products globally that help meet patient and procedural needs across a multitude of modalities. PDxs diagnostic agents are complementary to the imaging and ultrasound devices we offer, including CT, angiography and X-ray, MR, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET, and are also compatible with systems from other equipment vendors.
PDx operates within a strictly regulated industry with unique operational needs. Diagnostic agents require a sophisticated supply chain for manufacturing, supported by a global infrastructure of commercial, marketing, medical affairs, market access, application, regulatory, and pharmacovigilance teams that help monitor products. Customers require timely and reliable supply of diagnostic agents as shortages or delays can be highly disruptive to workflows and even cause exam cancellations.
Our PDx business develops and produces two types of imaging agents: contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals.

Contrast media are pharmaceuticals that are administered to a patient prior to certain diagnostic scans in order to increase the visibility of tissues or structures during imaging exams. Contrast media increases the diagnostic value of imaging and can be critical in the visualization of small or nuanced areas of diagnostic interest, such as cancer lesions or vascular structures, and to plan medical interventions, such as angioplasties, biopsies, or radiation therapy. We offer contrast media to three imaging modality groups: (1) CT, angiography, and X-ray, (2) MR, and (3) Ultrasound. Our business also includes contrast injection devices that are automated devices used to monitor and control the injection of contrast into patients, providing valuable productivity benefits in the imaging suite. We offer contrast injectors through collaborations with third-party original equipment manufacturers.

Radiopharmaceuticals, or molecular imaging agents, are molecular tracers labeled with radioisotopes that are injected into a patient prior to a diagnostic imaging scan. These agents work by accumulating in an area of diagnostic interest, such as a tumor, and emitting energy that is detected by a SPECT or PET scanner. Because they have specific molecular targets, they allow visualization and assessment of cell function, providing a more detailed dimension of biological activity. Our radiopharmaceuticals support diagnosis and therapy selection in various care areas, such as neurology, cardiology, and oncology, and are also used by pharmaceutical companies and researchers in selecting target populations for clinical trials.
Our unique combination of imaging equipment and pharmaceutical diagnostics enables building capabilities across disease states through diagnostic pharmaceuticals, hardware, software, and AI and digital solutions. Our strong portfolio of diagnostic agents and advanced global supply chain, combined with our imaging, cyclotron, and advanced visualization software, positions us to grow in existing markets as well as emerging adjacencies.
ACQUISITIONS
Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing business. Refer to Note 8, Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets for further information.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
Our research and development (R&D) efforts focus on scientific discovery and research into promising technologies that lead to potential healthcare applications, creating new products, services and solutions, discovery of novel clinical applications for on-market products and solutions, and enhancing our existing products to help improve outcomes for customers and their patients. We deliver value through innovative medical technology solutions across the patient care continuum (including screening, diagnosis, and therapy, monitoring) by leveraging hardware, software, AI, and digital technologies. We engage in and sponsor clinical research and product development through collaborations with universities, medical centers, and other organizations. We occasionally enter into agreements with third parties related to collaboration on R&D activities associated with the development of new or innovative products. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We have a substantial portfolio of intellectual property (IP). We rely on a combination of patent, design, utility model, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and regulatory exclusivity period protections, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our IP. Our IP team collaborates with our R&D and product teams to develop product-line-focused IP strategies and secure IP rights as appropriate. We generally file patent applications in the United States and other countries that have strong technology patent protections. We also license from third parties a variety of IP that complements our internal R&D efforts and our product offerings. While, in aggregate, our patents and other IP are vital to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole; rather, we believe understanding our customers needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing know-how are critical for our business.
7
We rely on confidentiality agreements with colleagues, contractors, consultants, and third parties to help protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. We also monitor development and commercialization activities of third parties so our IP rights are not infringed upon. In addition, we make infrastructure investments to secure our IP assets and conduct audits to assess the effectiveness of our IP protection program.
We believe that invention leads to value for our customers and stakeholders, and that a culture of innovation across GE HealthCare is a core element of our success.
As part of the Spin-Off from GE, we secured IP specific to our business and GE granted us a license to use other IP required for our business. We also entered into a long-term trademark license agreement with GE that enables GE HealthCare to continue building upon our brand.
COMPETITORS
The global medical technology industry is highly competitive and includes global and regional participants of all sizes that can vary by product line.

GLOBAL INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, SOURCING, AND LOGISTICS 
Our sourcing, production, and distribution network is managed globally while our products are manufactured at and distributed by facilities serving specific regions. We believe our global scale, complemented by local focus, allows us to provide our customers with improved supply chain security, reduced costs, and compliance with regional or national trade and marketing requirements. We have manufacturing, assembly, and pharmaceutical production in 43 facilities across 17 countries. We use globally managed and coordinated quality assurance programs across our manufacturing and distribution facilities, and we regularly inspect and audit our sites. We hold our suppliers to the same rigorous operating standards. Our supply chain design drives resilience and redundancy, including maintaining buffer capacity, diversifying our sourcing and manufacturing bases, and utilizing advanced risk-focused analytics. 
REGULATION
REGULATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.
The development, manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products are subject to stringent government regulation globally. We commit extensive resources to maintain compliance with these regulations.
The U.S., European Union (EU), and China are our most significant regions based on revenue and the regulatory landscape within these regions. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (for pharmaceuticals) and European National Competent Authorities and Notified Bodies (for devices) in Europe, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China and other government agencies, such as state and local authorities, in the United States, Europe, and China, administer strict requirements governing the design, development, testing, performance, safety, quality, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale, servicing, marketing, and post-market surveillance of medical products, including medical devices and pharmaceutical products. In addition, we are subject to applicable national and sub-national laws and regulations of other countries.
Our ability to market and sell our products globally depends upon our compliance with the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we develop, manufacture, or distribute our products. This requires, among other things, compliance with laws and regulations related to developing, testing, conducting clinical trials if needed, and receiving appropriate marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to commercialization of our products where necessary. We are also subject to extensive laws and regulations requiring ongoing compliance and monitoring of our products throughout the product lifecycle. For example, we have extensive processes and procedures for monitoring the post-market safety and performance of our products, reporting applicable events to regulators, and taking action to address potential safety or quality concerns where needed. In addition, regulators across the globe have the authority to conduct periodic inspections of our facilities, products, and Quality Management System processes and procedures to evaluate our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Regulators also monitor our advertising and promotion of products for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Complying with requirements imposed on our products and business is an ongoing process as we introduce additional products and/or product modifications and seek to comply with changing legal and regulatory requirements. The time required to obtain authorization to market and sell products varies by country. The ability to comply with global post-market requirements requires extensive and ongoing resources. An enforcement or adverse action by a regulator could limit our ability to obtain regulatory authorizations or impact our ability to develop, market, distribute, or otherwise make our products available, depending on the nature of the action.
DATA PRIVACY LAWS.
Due to our extensive global footprint and handling of personal data as both a data controller (on our own behalf) and data processor (on behalf of third parties, primarily customers), we are also subject to an extensive collection of global laws and regulations protecting the privacy, security, and integrity of the personal data, sensitive personal data, and patient health information that we create, receive, use, and maintain as a business.
Among the most relevant and material to our business, based on the volume and sensitivity of the data at issue, are: the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively HIPAA); the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), similar U.K. legislation resulting from the European Union (Withdrawal) Data Act of 2018 (U.K. GDPR), and other EU country-level laws; the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoias (Brazil LGPD); the various laws and accompanying regulations in China governing data privacy and cybersecurity (e.g., the Cybersecurity Law of the Peoples Republic of China, Personal Information Protection Law (China PIPL) & Data Security Law (China DSL)), the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of India, and significant privacy legislation recently adopted in the Middle East and Africa Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) Royal Decree No. M/19 on September 16, 2021. In addition, there are also various U.S. state-level laws (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), country regional laws, and proposed legislation that we monitor for applicability and impact to our business. These laws present a continuing challenge to businesses to structure their data collection, storage, use, and cross-border transmission in a compliant manner.
10
Many of these laws impose a significant compliance burden on organizations within their scope, and failure to comply can result in a variety of sanctions, including, with respect to GDPR, administrative fines for the most serious compliance failures up to 4% of a companys global total annual revenue of the preceding fiscal year. While there have been some recent enforcement actions by EU country-level data protection authorities resulting in substantial fines pursuant to GDPR, there remains uncertainty as to how data protection authorities throughout the rest of the globe will choose to interpret and enforce violations of applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., Brazil LGPD, China PIPL). Furthermore, these laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and further clarification in the form of implementing rules, guidelines, and related guidance from the data protection authorities is necessary to understand the full picture of the compliance obligations imposed on businesses within their scope. Additionally, in recent years, the EU has introduced upcoming legislation that would regulate the use and transfer of non-personal, technical data only.
GLOBAL HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE.
The marketing, promotion, and sale of medical devices, drugs, and services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. governments and agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of the delivery of healthcare items and services, representing governments interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Industry trade associations (such as Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) and MedTech) increasingly provide guidance on applicable laws and regulations.
U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals, and healthcare fraud and abuse. Similar state false claims, anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and insurance laws also apply to state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and colleagues to criminal and civil financial penalties and expose us to civil liability and risk of further enforcement action under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), the False Claims Act (FCA), or other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-cleared and -approved devices and drugs reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act), which requires us to annually track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians and other healthcare professionals or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states as well.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to or otherwise engaging in bribery of government officials. These laws apply to many of our customer interactions, as healthcare professionals in other countries are often considered government officials, and in some cases lay out requirements of how to operationalize compliance with the legal requirements. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries. Failure to comply with these laws may expose us to criminal and civil enforcement actions, monetary fines and penalties, and reputational harm.


If we do not successfully manage our collaboration arrangements, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties, we may not realize the expected benefits from such arrangements, which could adversely affect our business.

Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber crimes pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services, and data, as well as our reputation, and we may be unable to obtain, maintain, protect, or effectively enforce our IP rights, which could adversely affect our business.

If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel and qualified employees or maintain relations with our employees or other employee representatives, it could adversely affect our business.

Increasing attention to ESG matters, including environmental, health, and safety (EH&S) matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.

Our research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which could adversely affect our business.


Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect GE HealthCares business, financial condition, or results of operations.
INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC RISKS.
We operate in highly competitive markets, competition may increase in the future, and our industry may be disrupted, requiring us to lower prices or resulting in a loss of market share.
Healthcare markets are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, frequent introduction of new products, intense competition, and pricing pressures. We face substantial competition from international and domestic companies of all sizes; these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation. Our ability to compete successfully may be adversely affected by factors such as:

the introduction of new or more affordable products or product enhancements by competitors, including products that could substitute for our products or reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection;

the development of new technology, the application of known or unknown technology, advances in medicine, or new developments in the treatment or diagnosis of disease that transform our industry or render a product line obsolete;

competitors responding more quickly or effectively to new technology, or changes in customer requirements and industry trends;

a failure to satisfy local market conditions and regulations, such as mandatory IP transfers, protectionist measures, and other government policies supporting increased local competition;

the application of new or innovative business models to our industry;

the emergence of new market entrants, including those with innovative technology or substantial financial resources, such as startups or established technology companies;

a failure to maintain or expand relationships with existing customers or attract new customers;

cost of production or delivery, whether due to geographic location, currency fluctuations, taxes, tariffs, duties, or otherwise, which may enable our competitors to offer greater discounts or lower prices;

the perception of our brand and image in the market;

the strengthening of independent service organizations (ISOs) (third-party entities that specialize in the repair and maintenance of medical devices produced by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including us) and companies specializing in one or more of our operating segments or offerings;

a failure to successfully enter new geographic or adjacent product markets;

a failure to acquire or effectively integrate businesses and technologies that complement or expand our existing businesses;

changing regulatory standards, legal requirements, or enforcement rigor; or

consolidation among customers, suppliers, channel partners, or competitors.
15
The implementation of localization requirements and other government policies in certain geographies, driven by support of local industry, security of supply, and incentives for technological breakthroughs, could negatively affect our market share, business results, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, policies in countries such as China and Russia that require the purchase of locally manufactured products or that are favorable to locally-based manufacturers, and our ability or decision to meet the requirements of such policies, may affect customer purchasing decisions and may have an adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial results.
Our service organization allows us to deliver service offerings through an extensive network of field service engineers, global repair centers, and customer service centers. Increased competition from ISOs and evolving regulatory and legislative policies could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In the United States and Europe, ISOs continue to seek access to OEM service tools, parts, documents, software updates, and training. Specifically, in 2021, the Librarian of Congress in the United States authorized a copyright act exemption that allows unregulated third-party repair companies to circumvent OEM copyright protections on software in its medical imaging device or system if circumvention is necessary to diagnose, maintain, or repair such device or system. Furthermore, regulatory and legislative changes, such as the adoption of right-to-repair laws in the United States and elsewhere, could further strengthen the ability of ISOs to obtain valuable service contracts and directly compete with us in the services area. In addition to affecting our services business, the activities of ISOs could expose us to a number of other risks related to safety, quality, security, or performance of our products. This could increase compliance costs, require changes to our business practices, or otherwise impact our ability to compete in the services and repairs area.
Our inability to obtain and maintain regulatory authorizations for and supply commercial quantities of our offerings as quickly and effectively as our competitors could limit market acceptance. Additionally, our HealthCare Financial Services business is subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where it does business, including the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain countries in Latin America. Furthermore, our markets are continually evolving and thus revenues and income are difficult to forecast. 
In recent years, U.S. healthcare industry participants, including distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, healthcare providers, insurers, and pharmacy chains, have consolidated or formed strategic alliances. Consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power and may result in the loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents. Additionally, the U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to help increase access to medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs, and increase efficiencies. These changes include a general decline in and/or changes to public and private insurer reimbursement levels and payment models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and toward clinics, physician offices, and patients homes. We expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change in the future. Any of these factors could adversely affect our pricing, margins, and market share and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Global geopolitical and economic instability, as well as continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in regional economies, could adversely affect our business. 
We generate the majority of our revenue outside of the United States and our business is sensitive to global economic conditions. Slower global economic growth; actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt; volatility in the currency and credit markets; inflationary pressures; high levels of unemployment or underemployment; reduced levels of capital expenditures; changes or anticipation of potential changes in government fiscal, tax, import and export, and monetary policies; changes in capital requirements for financial institutions; disruptions in the financial services industry; government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics; sequestration; austerity measures; and other challenges that affect the global economy could adversely affect us and our customers, suppliers, and channel partners. Both the United States and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in 2023 and, to a lesser extent, 2024, and inflation rates in the United States, as well as in other countries in which we operate, may continue at elevated levels for the near term. In response, the Federal Reserve in the United States and other central banks in various countries have raised interest rates in response to concerns about inflation which may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty.  Economic instability could also cause renewed uncertainty in global markets and the investment climate to deteriorate. 
Our business is affected by global geopolitical conditions. Future geopolitical factors that have the effect of reducing capital expenditures generally, and for healthcare products, services, or solutions specifically, may negatively impact sales of our offerings and, as a result, make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, retain existing customers, or maintain sales at existing levels. For example, in March 2024, the government in China announced a new stimulus program (2024 stimulus) that includes the healthcare sector and is being implemented through Chinas provinces. In addition, an anti-corruption campaign directed at the healthcare sector remains ongoing. Both of these factors contributed to delayed orders and sales in our China business throughout 2024. While we expect the 2024 stimulus program to result in opportunities for our business in China in the longer term, it has had a short-term impact as provinces develop and announce their plans and customers begin to make purchasing decisions. We expect the effects of the delay in the 2024 stimulus and the anti-corruption campaign to continue to impact our orders and sales in the near term, although we are unable to predict the exact duration or magnitude of the impact.
16
The imposition of tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and other import and export restrictions have contributed to increased global economic uncertainty. The rise of economic nationalism could make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, retain existing customers, continue to produce and source in an optimal manner, or maintain sales at existing levels, both in the United States and in other countries. Geopolitical and economic risks have increased over the past few years in many regions of the world, including in the United States. Our operations expose us to the risk that increased trade protectionism may adversely affect our business. For example, in late 2024 and early 2025, the United States, China, and the European Union each announced either new tariffs, non-tariff barriers (principally related to participation in public procurement of healthcare equipment), or export controls. Any of these risks, ensuing retaliation, or the further deterioration of trade relations between countries could make our offerings more expensive or non-competitive in the affected countries. Growing tensions, protectionist trade policies, and tariffs may also lead to a fragmentation of the global economy, a general reduction of international trade in goods and services, and a reduction in the integration of financial markets, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Further risks stem from geopolitical tensions and volatility (such as in Cuba, Iran, Syria, Russia, North Korea, and Israel and surrounding areas), other future conflicts that may arise, and economic sanctions imposed relating to regions and persons included on sanctioned party lists. In particular, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia may negatively impact our revenue to the extent the conflict and the sanctions significantly impact our ability to sell products or services to customers in the affected regions, collect receivables from such customers, or repatriate cash we do collect. Given the nature of our products, we do not believe that the current sanctions and other measures imposed by the United States and other countries preclude us from conducting business in the region. However, these sanctions have made and will continue to make it more burdensome and costly to serve customers in these regions. Under the current U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, we are permitted to export, re-export, or transfer medical equipment and spare parts that meet stated criteria under a License Exception, which has eliminated the need for us to obtain individual U.S. licenses in most cases; however, licenses still may be needed for some transactions. The EU and other countries have also expanded licensing requirements for certain spare parts, services, software, and other items. We will continue to apply for licenses to supply to these customers and to support our business in Russia, as required. The implementation of these measures affected our ability to supply customers in Russia during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and will continue to do so as we confirm applicability of the U.S. License Exception to our transactions and continue to obtain licenses. There is no guarantee we will obtain all of the licenses for which we applied, that any approvals we obtain will be on a timely basis, or that our business in Russia will not be further disrupted due to evolving legal or operational considerations. In addition to the above, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control administers laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons in conducting activities, transacting business with, or making investments in certain countries or with governments, entities, and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security administers export controls that apply to products, software, and technology. If the sanctions, restrictions, and other retaliatory measures imposed by the global community change, we may be required to cease or suspend our operations in the region or we may voluntarily elect to do so. Additionally, elections in various countries may further exacerbate geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions and market instability. The lead up to these elections and their outcomes could result in sharp shifts in domestic, economic, and foreign policy approaches or even result in new or deepening geopolitical conflicts. We are continuously monitoring economic, political, and geopolitical developments to assess any potential future impact that may arise. 
The impact of geopolitical and economic developments globally will depend on a number of factors, including the effectiveness of measures by central banks and financial authorities. Such developments may also result in or coincide with reduced budgets for capital equipment and services, particularly if it becomes more difficult for our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. This, in turn, could cause our customers to reduce, delay, or abandon purchases of our offerings. An uncertain economic environment may also adversely affect our customers budgets and may result in pricing pressure, requests for extended warranty provisions, cancellation of service contracts, and could make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding receivables, especially in emerging markets.  Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, prospects, and the market price of our securities. 
Public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business, as well as on the operations and financial performance of some of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve.
Our operations and financial performance have been, and in the future may be, negatively impacted by public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including volatility in demand for our products, services, and solutions), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility in financial markets. Additionally, as a result of such events, we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety; site shutdowns; workplace disruptions; restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials, and goods (both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers); global supply chain disruptions; and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may in the future experience, unpredictable demand for our products, services, and solutions; customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications; supply chain under-liquidation; delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones; delays or cancellations of new projects and related down-payments; and other factors related, directly and indirectly, to the effects of any public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic on our customers that adversely impact our businesses.
17
The ultimate impact of any public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: the severity and duration of the public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic; the impact of variants and resurgences; governmental, business, and individuals actions in response to the public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic; the impact on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability, and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local, or non-U.S. funding programs; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of the ultimate recovery from the public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic.
Efforts by public and private payers to control the growth of healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements or increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers, which may affect the price of and demand for our products, services, or solutions.
Sales of many of our offerings directly or indirectly depend on the availability of reimbursement and the amount of reimbursement that our customers may seek from various third-party payers, including government programs, authorities, or agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), and private health plans. In general, employers and third-party payers, particularly in the United States, have become increasingly cost-conscious, with higher deductibles imposed in many medical plans. The imposition of higher deductibles tends to inhibit individuals from seeking the same level of medical treatments as they might seek if the costs were lower, particularly in the medical diagnostic portion of our business. Third-party payers have also increased utilization controls related to the use of our offerings by healthcare providers. 
Without adequate support from third-party payers, the market for our offerings may be limited and adversely impacted. Governments and other payers may institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of healthcare costs. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for our offerings from third-party payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which offerings customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Some countries impose drug price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products. Even if we develop promising new offerings, we may find limited demand for the offerings unless reimbursement approval is obtained from third-party payers. Further legislative or administrative reforms that impact reimbursements or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
In the United States, private third-party payers, although independent from Medicare, sometimes use portions of Medicare reimbursement policies and payment amounts in making their own reimbursement decisions. As a result, decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reimburse for a diagnosis or treatment, or changes to Medicares reimbursement policies or reductions in payment amounts with respect to a diagnosis or treatment, sometimes extend to U.S. third-party payers reimbursement policies and amounts for that diagnosis or treatment. Decision-making by our U.S. customers is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding Medicare reimbursement rates for certain procedures. From time to time, CMS and third-party payers may review and modify the factors upon which they rely to determine appropriate levels of reimbursement for certain diagnoses or treatments. In China, government authorities control the inclusion or removal of drugs from the Essential Drug List and the National Reimbursement Drug List, which govern reimbursement under state-sponsored health plans. The removal or reclassification of our products on Chinese national or provincial lists can affect the reimbursement or reimbursement rate of our products in China. Any significant cuts in reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement methodology or administration for procedures that use our offerings, or concerns or proposals regarding further cuts or changes in methodology or administration, could further increase uncertainty, adversely affect our customers decisions, reduce demand for our offerings, cause customers to cancel orders, and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS.
Our inability to successfully complete strategic transactions could adversely affect our business.
Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing business. Successful growth through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets or assets, conduct due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired target or asset successfully.
Acquisitions may expose us to significant risks and uncertainties, including:

competition for acquisition targets and assets, which may lead to substantial increases in purchase price or other terms that are less attractive to us, including the use of our shares for payment of the purchase price;

dependence on external sources of capital, in particular to finance the purchase price of acquisitions;

rulings by antitrust, foreign direct investment, or other regulatory bodies;

acquired companies previous failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;
18

failure to timely or successfully integrate acquired companies strategies, functions, systems, controls, including cybersecurity and data protection controls, and products into our own;

inability to produce products at increased scale or loss of previously available distribution channels;

heightened external scrutiny on acquired IP rights, regulatory exclusivity periods, and confidentiality agreements, or lack of IP rights for the acquired portfolio;

diversion of our managements attention from existing operations to the acquisition and integration process;

a failure to accurately predict or to realize expected growth opportunities, cost savings, synergies, and market acceptance of acquired companies products;

a failure to identify significant non-compliant behaviors or practices by, or liabilities relating to, an acquisition target (or its agents) prior to acquisition;

successor liability imposed by regulators for actions by a target (or its agents) prior to acquisition;

expenses, delays, and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing businesses; and

difficulties in retaining key customers and personnel.
Various other assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.
In addition, we also regularly evaluate a variety of other potential strategic transactions, including equity and other investments; strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives; and disposition of non-core assets. We may not successfully identify, complete, or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions, including those outlined above. Equity and other investments and strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and, in some cases, management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time; who may not have the same priorities, strategies, or resources as we do; or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own.
The occurrence of any of the above in connection with any acquisition or strategic transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Our increasing focus on and investment in cloud, edge computing, AI, and software offerings present risks to our business. We may not be successful in driving the global deployment and customer adoption of digital offerings characterized by digital applications and solutions. 
A growing part of our business involves cloud, edge computing, AI (including generative AI), and software solutions, and we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy such strategies. Our success with these solutions will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings. We incur costs to develop cloud, edge computing, AI, and software solutions and to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud and edge computing offerings. Success with these solutions depends on execution in many areas, including: 

establishing and maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud, edge computing, AI, and software solutions (including the reliability of our third-party software vendors, network, and cloud providers) on a growing array of medical devices, software, and equipment; 

continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our solutions to our customers in the face of increasing competition from a significant number of existing and new entrants in the market, while ensuring these solutions meet their reliability and security expectations; and 

ensuring these solutions meet regulatory requirements in a fast-moving space disrupted by changing regulations around data and the need for innovation, including obtaining marketing authorizations when required. 
19
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract customers or generate revenue required to succeed in this highly competitive and rapidly changing global market. We commit substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to R&D and IT infrastructure for our digital offerings, and the risk of failure is inherent. Even where our digital offerings satisfy applicable regulations and reimbursement policies, customers may not adopt them due to concerns about the security of personal data or the customers absence of digital infrastructure to support and effectively use the offerings, a hesitancy to embrace new technology, or for other reasons. We also may not effectively execute organizational and technical changes to accelerate innovation and execution. In a number of countries, some cloud, edge computing, AI, and software solutions are restricted areas of foreign investment. Collaborating with a domestic, qualified third party will increase costs and may create uncertainties in such jurisdictions. The legality or validity of any collaboration may be challenged or subjected to scrutiny in such jurisdictions and the relevant governmental authorities have broad discretion in addressing such arrangements. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Cloud, edge computing, and software solutions in healthcare must comply with stringent regulations, including certification requirements, in many of the countries in which our customers are located, particularly in relation to obtaining, using, storing, and transferring personal data. Our software solutions must be compliant with applicable regulations in the country in question before we can launch our offerings. In some jurisdictions, we must obtain marketing authorizations before commercializing software solutions. Such regulatory compliance may take longer or cost more than expected or require that design changes be incorporated into our offerings. In addition, changes to reimbursement policies for digital healthcare offerings could potentially lead to delays and additional expense. The inability of customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from private and governmental third-party payers could adversely affect purchasing decisions and prices and cause our revenue and profitability to suffer. 
Additionally, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives and are building AI into many of our digital offerings. We are planning to leverage generative AI such as large language models across our portfolios to build differentiated products and solutions and deploy those solutions through various modalities for our customers, including on the device, via edge computing or data centers, and/or via the cloud. Using AI in this manner presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, acceptance, and effectiveness, including flawed AI algorithms; insufficient, overbroad, or biased datasets; unauthorized access to personal data; lack of acceptance from our customers; or failure to deliver positive outcomes. As we seek to build clinical applications that leverage generative AI models built by third parties, we may have limited rights to access the underlying intellectual property used to create the generative AI model, and, if requested, this may limit or impair our ability to independently verify the explainability, transparency, and reliability of the underlying model. The use of AI in healthcare offerings also poses certain clinical risks resulting from potential misdiagnosis or misinformation provided from AI applications, diminishing critical judgment, or loss of interpersonal care from clinicians. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, as well as their adoption, subjecting us to competitive harm; legal liability, including under new legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the EU or new applications of existing data protection, privacy, IP, and other laws; regulatory actions; and reputational harm. Additionally, our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. In addition, some AI scenarios present ethical, privacy, or other social issues, risking reputational harm and/or reduced market demand or acceptance of AI solutions. The safeguards we have designed to promote the ethical implementation of AI may not be sufficient to protect us against negative outcomes. Furthermore, we contract with numerous third parties to offer our digital content to customers as well as to assist with the development of their own software applications and services, and our reliance on access to these third parties healthcare digital applications, which may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could impact our ability to offer a wide variety of our own digital offerings at reasonable prices with acceptable usage tools, or continue to expand our geographic reach. All of these risks are amplified by the critical nature of healthcare decisions and the sensitivity of health-related information, and the occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Our inability to manage our supply chain or obtain supplies of components or raw materials has restricted, and could continue to restrict, the manufacturing of products, cause delays in delivery, or significantly increase our costs, and our use of third parties in various markets and their actions or inactions could affect our business.
We rely on the timely supply of components, products, services, and solutions. If suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations, raise prices, or cease to supply to us, it may affect our ability to deliver to our customers or significantly increase our costs. If we lose suppliers, if their operations are substantially interrupted, if their prices increase significantly due to inflationary pressures, or if any of them fail to meet performance or quality specifications, we may be required to identify and qualify one or more replacement suppliers. This also may require us to redesign or modify our products to incorporate new components and obtain regulatory authorization, qualification, or certification of these redesigned or modified products. Further, we have multiple single-source or sole-source suppliers with no alternatives yet identified. Our dependence on such single- or sole-source suppliers subjects us to possible risks of shortages, interruptions, and price fluctuations. Disruptions or loss of any of our single- or sole-source suppliers, or capacity limitations of the suppliers for components, could increase our costs, curtail growth opportunities, cause material delays, and adversely impact our business, financial results, and customer relationships.
20
Supply chain interruptions or price increases in certain key countries, such as China, India, Russia, and Israel, have had, and could continue to have, a similar adverse effect on our business. The costs of certain raw materials, logistics, and services necessary for the production and distribution of our products are subject to fluctuation based on many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions, labor costs, transportation costs, and currency exchange rates.
We rely upon supplies of certain raw materials, including helium, iodine, and rare earth minerals. Worldwide demand, availability, and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that to continue in the future. If supply of these materials is restricted or if prices increase, this could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our business results, cash flows, and financial condition.
The risks of disruption described above, as well as the risks arising from war, geopolitical conflicts, government sanctions or trade controls, imposition of tariffs, natural disasters, climate change-related physical and transitional risks, actual or threatened public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions impacting information technology systems, or other business continuity events, could adversely affect our operations and our suppliers ability to deliver, and limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our financial results and condition. By way of example, we were adversely affected by the inability of our suppliers to deliver components and raw materials on a timely basis in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, we cannot guarantee that the mitigation strategies we employ, such as internal and third-party risk management tools, maintaining objective evidence of our suppliers compliance with minimum viable quality standards and audits of conformance with these standards, conducting ongoing supplier and internal audits, developing resiliency plans, and investing in our internal data and analytic architecture, will be successful or that we will be able to alter our strategies or develop new strategies if and as needed.
We have replaced certain internal capabilities with outsourced products, services, or solutions. These processes may result in increased dependency on external suppliers and other third parties. Failure of third-party suppliers to establish and comply with required quality management systems or comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements may also lead to withdrawals of our certifications or authorizations required for market access in certain jurisdictions. Such supplier failures may prevent us from meeting customer requirements in a timely manner, which could result in damages or other claims, order cancellations, loss of market share, and damage to our reputation. Shortages or delays could adversely affect our business. A general shortage of materials or components also poses the risk of unforeseeable fluctuations in prices and demand. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Additionally, the implementation of localization requirements and other government policies driven by support of local industry, and increasing attention to ESG matters, including EH&S matters, may impose additional costs and requirements on our business, such as the need to qualify new local suppliers or comply with new material reporting requirements, which could negatively affect our ability to compete in certain markets.
Our business dealings also involve other third parties such as distributors, dealers, wholesalers, packagers, resellers, agents, collaboration partners, sub-contractors, and others. We rely on third-party transport and warehouse management services for reliable and secure point-to-point transportation of our products to our customers and patients, tracking of these shipments, and warehousing of our products. If any of these third parties were to encounter delivery performance issues or other disruptions leading to the loss, damage, or destruction of our products, it would be costly to replace these products in a timely manner. This may damage our reputation and result in decreased demand for our products. In turn, these third parties may use sub-parties. Such dealings expose us to known and unknown risks, including risks related to economic, political, and regulatory environments; performance and quality control; business continuity in the event of termination or other events; conflicts of interest; cybersecurity events; and violations of regulations and laws, including anti-corruption laws, by these third parties or their sub-parties. We cannot control the day-to-day practices of these third parties and cannot guarantee they will comply with our quality standards, contractual requirements, applicable law, and company policies regarding compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. If these third parties do not follow our standards or violate local laws and regulations, we could suffer commercial, financial, or reputational harm, which could jeopardize our ability to continue doing business in these markets or cause our relationships to deteriorate. 
Any interruption in the operations of our facilities, or our suppliers, customers, or third-party providers facilities, may impair our ability to deliver products or provide services.
We are dependent on our global production and operating network to develop, manufacture, assemble, supply, transport, ship, warehouse, and service our offerings. A work stoppage, labor shortage, or other production limitation, including import or export restrictions and transportation issues, among others, could occur at our facilities, facilities of suppliers or other third parties on which we rely, or customer facilities, and could negatively impact our reputation and market position. Such interruptions may occur for several reasons, including as a result of regulatory enforcement actions, tight credit markets or other financial distress, production constraints or difficulties, unscheduled downtimes, war, severe weather and natural disasters, fires and explosions, accidents, mechanical failures, pandemics, civil unrest, strikes, unpermitted releases of toxic or hazardous substances, other EH&S risks, sabotage, cybersecurity attacks, riots, or terrorist attacks.
21
Any significant event affecting one of our production or operating facilities may result in a disruption to our ability to supply customers, and standby capacity necessary for the reliable operation of the facility may not be sufficiently available. The impact of these risks is heightened if our production capacity is at or near full utilization (or if we lack alternative manufacturing sites) and could result in our inability to accept orders or deliver products in a timely manner. Additionally, significant capital investment to increase manufacturing capacity may be required to expand our business or meet increased demand for our products in the future. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
If we do not successfully manage our collaboration arrangements, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties, we may not realize the expected benefits from such arrangements, which could adversely affect our business. 
From time to time, we enter into collaborations, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties to complement or augment our capabilities, including in R&D, product development, manufacturing, and marketing. Evaluating, appropriately structuring, negotiating, and implementing such arrangements may be a lengthy and complex process and must meet with applicable business, legal, and compliance requirements. Other companies may compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, we may not identify, secure, or complete such arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or on otherwise favorable terms, if at all. 
We may not realize the expected benefits from these arrangements. We may not be able to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any such collaboration, licensing arrangement, joint venture, or strategic alliance. This could create the risk of impasses on decisions, given that our partners in these arrangements may have economic or business interests that diverge from our interests. Conflicts may arise in these arrangements concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement (including financial obligations), termination rights, or the ownership or control of IP developed during the arrangement. Our partners may suffer adverse commercial, financial, or legal circumstances that are outside of our control and may jeopardize their success, our partners may terminate their relationships with us, or breakdowns in these relationships may give rise to disputes. Given the potentially different interests of the parties involved, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. 
These arrangements may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase expenditures, or disrupt our ordinary business activities. These arrangements may expose us to known and unknown risks, including unique risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment of any foreign entities with which we partner, quality control, and legal and regulatory violations committed by partners whose actions are outside of our control. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber crimes pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services, and data, as well as our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. 
We manufacture and sell products that rely upon software and computer systems to operate properly and process and store confidential information. Our products often are connected to, and reside within, our customers IT infrastructures. In some jurisdictions, we are expected to design our products to include appropriate cybersecurity protections, and regulatory authorities may review such protections when granting marketing authorizations. 
While we seek to protect our products and IT systems from unauthorized access, these measures may not be effective, particularly because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, increase in sophistication, and often are not identified at the time that they are launched against a target. These risks apply to our installed base of products, products we currently sell, new products we will introduce in the future, and older technology that we no longer sell or service but remains in use by customers. Additionally, we offer software, cloud, and edge computing products that are developed, controlled, or hosted by third-party providers. A cybersecurity breach of or other disruption to our systems or products, service providers network security and systems, or other third-party services could disrupt treatment being delivered to patients or interfere with our customers operations, and could lead to the loss of, damage to, or public disclosure of our employees and customers stored information, including personal data, such as individually identifiable health information (including protected health information or PHI). Such an event could have serious negative consequences, including alleged customer or patient harm, obligations to notify enforcement authorities or users of our products, voluntary or forced recalls of or modifications to our products, regulatory actions, fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for or use of our offerings by customers, harm to our reputation, and time-consuming and expensive litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
There are increasingly large volumes of information, including patient data, being generated that need to be securely processed and stored by healthcare organizations. Our IT systems have been subject to computer malware, unauthorized access, and other cyber-attacks. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cybersecurity threats we and our service providers face, and we expect these activities to continue to increase. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the increased adoption of AI technologies, may further heighten the risk of cyber-attacks. Additionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further risks and challenges, including the possibility of 
22
creating new attack methods for adversaries. The use of AI to support business operations carries inherent risks related to data privacy, IP, and security, such as intended, unintended, or inadvertent transmission of proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, as well as challenges related to implementing and maintaining AI tools, such as developing and maintaining appropriate datasets for such support. If we fail to implement adequate safeguards, the use of AI may introduce additional operational, legal, or regulatory vulnerabilities such as producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data or methodologies, or unintended results. 
Furthermore, we may also be exposed to a more significant risk if such actions are taken by state or state-affiliated actors. The objectives of these cyber-attacks vary widely and may include, among other things, unauthorized access to personal, customer, or third-party information, disruptions in operations and the provision of services to customers, or theft of IP or other sensitive assets or information belonging to us, our business partners, or customers. As such attacks become more effective, the risks in this area continue to grow. The back-up systems we have in place may not be adequate in the event of a failure or interruption. We may not have current capabilities to identify all vulnerabilities, which may allow others to exploit persistent potential exposures within our IT systems and products. We could suffer significant business disruption, including transaction errors, supply chain or manufacturing interruptions, processing inefficiencies, data loss, loss of customers, reputational damage, the loss of or damage to IP or other proprietary information, litigation, investigations, and possible liability to employees, customers, suppliers, patients, and regulatory authorities as a result of a successful cyber-attack or other disruption impacting our IT systems. Further, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations may be impaired by such cyber-attacks or disruptions. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects, and on the timeliness of reporting our operating results. 
We rely on software, SaaS, hardware, and other material components from a number of third parties to manufacture our products. If a material cyber incident or other disruption impacting a supplier were to result in its prolonged inability to use, manufacture, and/or ship such components, this could impact our ability to manufacture and/or use our products. In addition, third-party sourced software components, malicious code, or a critical vulnerability or error emerging within such software could expose our customers to increased cyber risk. Efforts we have undertaken to mitigate such risks may not prevent all incidents. 
If we were to experience a significant cybersecurity breach or other disruption impacting our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation, and potential notification of the incident to customers, regulators, and counterparties, as well as any related litigation expenses, fines, penalties, or damages, could be material. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. The data privacy and IT security insurance coverage we currently maintain may be inadequate. In addition, the market for such insurance continues to evolve and, in the future, our data privacy and IT security insurance coverage may be prohibitively expensive or not available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, or at all. 
We may be unable to obtain, maintain, protect, or effectively enforce our IP rights.
 
We place considerable emphasis on obtaining, maintaining, and using our IP to support our business strategy. We pursue IP protection in key jurisdictions to protect our R&D investment and limit the risk of infringing third-party IP rights. However, we cannot ensure that our means of obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our IP rights will be adequate to maintain a competitive advantage. 
The laws of many jurisdictions may not protect our IP rights or provide an adequate forum to effectively address situations where our IP rights have been compromised. Furthermore, protecting against the unauthorized use of proprietary technology may be difficult, expensive, and drawn out. We may need to litigate with third parties to enforce or defend patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Determining whether an offering infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates a third partys IP rights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain and inconsistent. This is true for our major markets, including China, as well as developing markets with less developed IP systems. An adverse determination in any such litigation, or significant delays in obtaining effective relief, could materially impair our IP rights and may harm our business. 
From time to time, we receive notices from third parties asserting infringement, misappropriation, or violation of their IP rights. We are also subject to lawsuits alleging infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of third-party IP rights. When such claims are asserted against us (or to avoid such claims), we may seek to license the third partys IP rights, which may be costly. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain an adequate license, we may be subject to lawsuits seeking damages or an injunction against the manufacture, import, marketing, sale, or operation of our offerings or against the operation of our business as presently conducted. We do not maintain insurance for claims or litigation involving the infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of IP rights. Regardless of the merits or outcome, the resolution of any IP dispute could require significant financial and management resources. 
Adverse judicial rulings or our entry into any license or settlement agreement in connection with third-party claims could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Our agreements with our customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of IP claims. We may not always be successful in limiting our liability with respect to such obligations and could become subject to large indemnity payments or damages claims from contractual breach, which could harm our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
23
Furthermore, protecting confidential information and trade secrets can be difficult and, even if a successful enforcement action is brought, such action may not be effective in protecting our IP rights. Additionally, the increased sharing of our data with third parties as a result of right-to-repair legislation or EU data legislation laws could increase the risk of loss or damage to our IP. If we cannot adequately obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our IP rights, our competitors may be able to compete more successfully against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
We may not receive protection for pending or future applications relating to IP rights owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued IP rights may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products, services, solutions, and any associated trademarks. Products sold by our competitors may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate IP rights owned or licensed by us. Any issued IP rights owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, or circumvented in litigation or other proceedings, and these limited IP rights may not provide us with effective competitive advantages. IP rights may also be unavailable, limited, unenforceable, or practically unenforceable in some countries, and some governments may require us to transfer our IP rights to local entities to do business in the jurisdiction, either of which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position and compete with us. We may also incur substantial costs to protect ourselves in litigation or other proceedings involving the validity and enforceability of our IP rights. If claims against us are successful, we could lose valuable IP rights. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. We also rely on agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that such provisions will be enforceable, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. 
We do not own the GE trademark or logo, and we entered into a Trademark License Agreement with GE in connection with the Spin-Off (the Trademark License Agreement), pursuant to which GE granted us a license to use specified trademarks, which include the GE Monogram and the GE HealthCare word mark for use in connection with certain of our products, services, and solutions, as well as the right to use the GE brand in connection with certain legal entity names within our corporate structure. GE owns and controls the GE brand, and the integrity and strength of the GE brand will depend in large part on the efforts and businesses of GE and other licensees of the GE brand and how the brand is used, promoted, and protected by them, which will be outside of our control. Furthermore, there are certain circumstances under which the Trademark License Agreement may be terminated. Termination of the Trademark License Agreement would eliminate our rights to use the specified trademarks granted to us under this agreement and may result in our having to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under the Trademark License Agreement, which would require us to change our corporate name and undergo significant rebranding efforts. Any rebranding efforts may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel and qualified employees or maintain relations with our employees, unions, and other employee representatives, it could adversely affect our business.
There is substantial competition for key personnel, senior management, and qualified employees in the healthcare industry, and we may face increased competition for such a highly qualified scientific, technical, clinical, and management workforce in a highly competitive environment. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees in senior roles, we use equity-based awards and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, can reduce the retention value of our equity-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel.
Having a diverse and inclusive workplace can also enhance our ability to attract and retain talent and is an important driver of our ability to compete and innovate. As such, our inability to attract and retain diverse talent can have adverse consequences on our business. 
Certain of our employees in the United States and elsewhere are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically contain provisions regarding the general working conditions of our employees, including provisions that could affect our ability to restructure our operations, close facilities, or reduce our number of employees. We may not be able to extend existing collective bargaining agreements or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes, or similar actions.
The loss of one or more key employees; our inability to attract or develop additional qualified employees; any delay in hiring key personnel; any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions, and other employee representatives; or any material work stoppage, strike, or similar action could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, our actions or responses to any such negotiations, labor disputes, work stoppages, or strikes could negatively impact our corporate reputation and have adverse effects on our business. 
24
Increasing attention to ESG matters, including EH&S matters, may impose additional costs on our business and expose us to new risks. 
We face attention from investors, regulators, and other stakeholders, who may have conflicting views, related to our ESG positions, performance, and disclosures. Third-party organizations that provide information to investors on ESG matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their respective approaches. If we receive unfavorable ESG ratings or otherwise draw scrutiny for the positions we take or do not take on these matters, it could be used by investors, lenders, and customers to inform their investment, financing, or purchasing decisions, which could have a negative impact on our business. 
We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements that focus on our ESG positions, performance, and disclosures. These requirements continue to broaden and may be conflicting, both in terms of scope and geography, a trend we expect to continue. Our processes and controls for reporting of ESG matters may not always conform with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals, or reported progress in achieving our goals. A failure to adequately meet regulatory expectations may result in non-compliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.
We have established and publicly announced details of our ESG program, including goals related to addressing climate change. While these goals reflect our current plans and aspirations, we may need to adjust or revise them in light of changes to the assumptions made at the time they were set or the emergence of risks related to our ability to deliver them. These risks include the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; the suitability, cost, and availability of materials and technologies; and the possible organic growth of our business.
We are also subject to international, national, state, and local laws, regulations, industry and customer standards, and other voluntary commitments related to EH&S matters. These EH&S laws, regulations, standards, and commitments apply to a broad range of activities across our whole product lifecycle, including those related to (1) protection of the environment, protected species, and use of natural resources; (2) occupational health, safety, and well-being; (3) the use, handling, management, release, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous waste, radio chemical materials, and other hazardous or toxic materials; (4) our products, including the use of certain chemicals in our products and production processes; (5) emissions to air, land, and water; and (6) climate change.
The requirements we are subject to impose certain responsibilities on our business, including the obligation to install pollution control technologies and to obtain and maintain various environmental permits, the cost of which may be substantial. They can also impose cleanup liabilities, including with respect to discontinued or predecessor operations or third-party waste disposal sites. In some jurisdictions we are, and are likely to increasingly be, subject to climate change mitigation and adaptation regulation, tax, disclosure, and reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal fines and penalties; remediation costs; enforcement actions; the suspension or termination of our permits or operations; third-party claims; or other sanctions.  
The implementation of new or existing EH&S laws, regulations, and industry and customer standards, and any changes to them, which we cannot predict and which have historically become more stringent over time, could increase our costs and require us to reassess our business priorities. Administrative decisions, legal developments, or other governmental or judicial actions may influence the interpretation or enforcement of EH&S laws, regulations, and industry standards, and may thereby increase compliance or other costs. In addition, EH&S laws, regulations, and standards may also have an adverse impact on our ability to develop our products and to maintain and grow access to certain markets. EH&S laws and regulations enacted world-wide may require us to re-design products or production processes, or to cease using certain substances, leading to detrimental operational impacts and an increase in operating costs. Any of these risks or costs, and our ability to assess, prepare for, and fully comply with future EH&S laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Our products and operations utilizing radioactive materials are subject to varying international, federal, state, and local regulations and must be conducted in accordance with a number of licenses and certifications. The handling and disposal of radioactive materials and wastes may impose significant requirements and costs, including with respect to the decommissioning of facilities handling radioactive materials. Disposal sites for the lawful disposal of materials or wastes associated with our products may be limited or non-existent, may no longer accept these materials in the future, or may accept them on unfavorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations. 
Our research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which could adversely affect our business. 
To remain competitive, we must continue to launch new products, services, and solutions, requiring substantial investment in R&D. If we cannot successfully introduce new offerings that address the needs of our customers, our offerings may become obsolete, and our business results, cash flows, and financial condition could suffer. 
Many of our offerings have lengthy development and commercialization cycles. Promising new products, services, and solutions may fail to reach the market at all or at the right time, or may have only limited commercial success due to reasons including safety or efficacy concerns, failure to achieve positive outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory authorizations, or third-party reimbursement decisions. Additionally, new offerings may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing 
25
industry standards, or competitors innovations or reverse engineering efforts. It is uncertain when or whether our products, services, or solutions currently under development will be launched or will be commercially successful. Any of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, and prospects. 
If our Spin-Off from GE is determined to be a taxable transaction, it could result in significant tax liability to GE and its stockholders and we could have an indemnification obligation to GE, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. 
Prior to the completion of the Spin-Off, GE received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) to the effect that, among other things, our Spin-Off from GE will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and (2) a written opinion from each of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Ernst & Young, LLP (EY) to the effect that the Spin-Off will qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code.
The opinion of counsel and the opinion of EY do not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the Spin-Off.
In addition, the opinion of counsel, the opinion of EY, and the private letter ruling rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from GE and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, GE and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel, the opinion of EY, or the private letter ruling and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. 
The opinion of counsel and the opinion of EY is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the opinion of EY, or the private letter ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off or any of certain related transactions is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of GE or us after the Spin-Off. If the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel or the opinion of EY are challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences of the Spin-Off (including the tax consequences to GE and the U.S. Holders (as defined in the Code)) could be materially less favorable. 
If, as a result of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required by the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify GE for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Those amounts could be material and any such obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS.
The U.S. FDA and equivalent global agencies tightly regulate and actively enforce the laws and regulations governing the development, authorization, and commercialization of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. 
We are subject to rigorous regulation governing development, product testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, safety, quality, storage, marketing clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, sales and distribution, performance and effectiveness, and post-market surveillance. The U.S. FDA, the various competent authorities of the EU member states or other European countries that enforce the EUs Medical Device Regulation, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Regulation of Pharmaceuticals in the EU, and the NMPA in China are the regulatory authorities affecting us most prominently with respect to the commercialization of our products, services, and solutions. There are numerous other regulatory schemes in our countries around the globe at the national and sub-national levels. Regulations pertaining to our products are increasing in previously unregulated countries and are becoming more stringent in already regulated countries. Regulatory premarket clearance, approval, or conformity assessment requirements may affect or delay our ability to market new offerings.  The need to comply with regulations is a substantial controlling, operational, and reputational risk. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in governmental investigations, fines, and other sanctions, the temporary or permanent shutdown of production facilities, recalls of products, product withdrawals, revocation of marketing authorizations, disqualification from participation in healthcare activities, third-party and purported whistleblower claims, import detentions, and negative publicity, which could have adverse consequences on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
We must conduct clinical trials on humans before we commercialize certain products. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs and delays in regulatory authorizations and products reaching the market. These regulations can be burdensome and subject to change, exposing us to the risk of increased costs and business disruption. Changes to current products and labeling may also be subject to vigorous review, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. 
26
We are subject to regulations requiring restrictions, certification, and/or licensing of our facilities, and our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities. Adverse inspection outcomes have in the past, and may in the future, impact our ability to develop, manufacture, market, or distribute certain products. 
We also carefully monitor the quality and performance of our products once they are distributed. We may identify problems with product design, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, or other issues that impact the safety, quality, or performance of our products. These types of issues have in the past, and could in the future, create risk to patients, clinicians, or other personnel in contact with our products and lead to product recalls, removals, replacement, servicing, or other corrective actions. This can also create risk of enforcement action by regulatory authorities and increased product liability risk. 
Regulatory scrutiny may increase in the future and could require us to change the way we operate, including the way in which we offer certain services. Regulations are increasing and becoming more stringent in already regulated countries, and countries that did not previously regulate medical products are developing and implementing regulations for these products. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction, are complex, change frequently, are subject to changes in interpretation and enforcement. Moreover, certain fields, such as cloud and edge computing, clinical decision support software, cybersecurity, mobile medical applications, AI, generative AI, and Machine Learning are rapidly evolving within the industry and particularly subject to changing law and regulation. New or changing regulations can delay or otherwise adversely impact our ability to bring certain products to market. 
Regulatory authorities in many countries regulate the advertising and promotion of our offerings to ensure that our claims are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, that there is data to substantiate the claims, and that our materials are not false or misleading. If we or any of our suppliers, channel partners, or agents fail to comply with laws and regulations related to promotional labeling and advertising and are perceived to potentially be false, misleading, or otherwise not permissible, we may face legal or regulatory actions. 
Additionally, if a regulatory authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that our products pose an unreasonable risk for patients, users, or others, regulatory authorities may refuse to accept or authorize regulatory filings; ban such offerings; detain or seize unadulterated or misbranded products; order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products; or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the offerings present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to public health. A regulatory authority may impose operating restrictions or enjoin certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices or pharmaceutical products and assess civil or criminal penalties against us. The regulatory authority may also recommend prosecution by law enforcement agencies. Any new legislation or regulation or any changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing legislation or regulation may impose significant and costly new obligations on us, which may interrupt our supply of products, delay launch of new offerings, or negatively affect our cost of doing business. Given all of the foregoing, future costs and liabilities relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
The failure to comply with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws globally has resulted and could continue to result in civil or criminal sanctions and adversely affect our business. 
The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (UKBA), and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from offering and making corrupt payments to or otherwise engaging in bribery of government officials. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced elevated levels of public sector corruption. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities, the employees of which may be considered government officials under such laws. Many anti-corruption laws, such as the UKBA, also prohibit bribery of private sector individuals, and thus extend far beyond interactions with government officials. We also are subject to the FCPAs accounting provisions, which require us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances of managements control, authority, and responsibility over our assets. Non-U.S. companies, including some of our competitors, may not be subject to the provisions of the FCPA. If these competitors engage in corrupt practices, they may gain a business advantage. 
Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosure by companies, aggressive investigations (including coordinated investigations across countries and governmental authorities) and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant civil and criminal fines, penalties, and other sanctions against companies and individuals. Companies in the healthcare sector have been a particular focus of government enforcement in recent years. We also face the risk of unauthorized payments, offers of payments, or requests for payments being made by our employees, intermediaries, third parties and their sub-parties, customers or customer representatives, consultants, or other representatives. We may face liability under anti-corruption laws based upon the actions or inactions of these parties even when they are not subject to our control and/or are not contractually bound to us. We may also face liability from employee misconduct, such as fraud, which cannot always be deterred or prevented. Enforcement of anti-corruption laws in the healthcare industry in recent years has focused on international operations, particularly in countries such as China, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. Chinas anti-corruption agency, the National Supervisory Commission, has the power to investigate government officials and individuals employed by state-owned entities and public institutions and to collect evidence (including from private companies and individuals), seize assets, and recommend cases for prosecution. In prior years, the Chinese judicial branch has publicly disclosed an increasing number of 
27
judgments against government officials and others found to have engaged in corruption and other misconduct across many industries; certain of these judgments contain references that identify some of our products, employees, and channel partners. We review these judgments and other concerns we identify and conduct internal inquiries where appropriate. In 2023, Chinas Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the National Supervisory Commission, and other governmental entities in China initiated an anti-corruption campaign focused on the healthcare sector, which contributed to delayed orders and sales in our China business. We expect the effects of the anti-corruption campaign to continue to impact our orders and sales in the near term, although we are unable to predict the exact duration or magnitude of the impact. The China anti-corruption campaign has resulted and may result in the investigation of and/or judgments against individuals, including our employees, and entities operating in the healthcare sector. Any enforcement proceedings related to this campaign against us or our employees could subject us to civil and criminal fines, penalties, and other sanctions. Additionally, we are also subject to Chinas Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Consequences for violations include civil, administrative, and criminal penalties for businesses that commit acts of unfair competition (including commercial bribery). 
It is our policy to develop and implement safeguards and to educate our employees and certain third parties concerning these legal requirements and to prohibit improper practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and employees or certain third parties may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible or suffer reputational harm. 
Any alleged or actual violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to government scrutiny; criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions; stockholder lawsuits; reputational damage; and other liabilities. From time to time, we make self-disclosures regarding our compliance with the FCPA and similar laws to relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us. We, with the assistance of outside counsel, made voluntary self-disclosures to the SEC and the DOJ beginning in 2018 regarding tender irregularities and other potential violations of the FCPA relating to our activities in certain provinces in China. We have been engaged in ongoing discussions with each of the SEC and the DOJ regarding these matters. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope, result, or related costs associated with these disclosures to the SEC and the DOJ. We also are unable to predict what, if any, action may be taken by the SEC or the DOJ or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, including applicable foreign laws, could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses. Furthermore, a violation of certain anti-corruption laws could result in exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, governmental entities may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we may acquire. The costs associated with the investigation, remediation, and potential notification of any violation to customers, regulators, and counterparties could be material. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
We are subject to anti-kickback and false claims laws (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our business, including via sanctions and conditions on business activity. 
Claims generated as a result of kickbacks may be treated as false or fraudulent. In the U.S., the U.S. False Claims Act (the FCA) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover civil penalties and treble damages. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts, and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial ongoing reporting, monitoring, and other remedial actions. A failure by any of our employees or agents to abide by the policies and procedures we have in place to comply with these laws and regulations could result in potential criminal or civil penalties and damages against us, which may include treble damages, fines, or penalties under the FCA. 
If we are not successful in defending ourselves, violations of fraud and abuse laws could have a significant impact on our business, including the potential imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in certain government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
We are subject to antitrust and competition laws that can result in sanctions and conditions on the way we conduct our business.
We are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which generally prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, including price fixing, bid rigging, cartel activities, price discrimination, market monopolization, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors, and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Regulatory authorities may have authority to impose fines and sanctions or to require changes or impose conditions on the way we conduct business in connection with alleged non-compliance with applicable law. Under certain circumstances, violations of antitrust laws could result in suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with certain parties or complete certain transactions. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive conduct. Increased government scrutiny of our actions or enforcement of private rights of action could adversely affect our business or damage our reputation. Conducting internal investigations or responding to audits or investigations by government agencies could be costly and 
28
time-consuming. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or criminal or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
We are subject to stringent privacy laws and information security regulations.
 
Our products and systems receive, generate, and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information, such as employee, supplier, customer, and patient data. Moreover, our digital ecosystem enables our customers to store personal data of their patients in cloud solutions that are hosted by us using third-party cloud providers. There are additional regulations relating to cloud data protection and privacy, which heightens our risks associated with the protection of such information. We have legal and contractual obligations regarding the protection of confidential and personal information and the appropriate collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of such data. Additionally, regulators within the United States, European Union, and around the world are evaluating how best to regulate development and use of data generated by connected product or service as well as AI technologies. We are subject to various privacy law regimes in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, including comprehensive regulatory systems in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific and sector-specific requirements. Certain international jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular jurisdiction be physically stored within that jurisdiction. 
These laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we cannot be sure how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, enforced, or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures, and systems. If we, or third parties, fail to adequately safeguard confidential and personal data, or if such information or data are wrongfully used by us or third parties, or disclosed to unauthorized persons or entities, such an event may result in fines, penalties, and harm to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. For additional information see Data Privacy Laws under Item 1, Business.
Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, as well as adverse outcomes of ongoing and future tax audits, could adversely affect our business and our ability to use deferred tax assets. 
We are subject to income and other non-income taxes (including sales, excise, and value-added) in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Thus, the tax treatment of transactions we execute is subject to changes in tax laws or regulations, tax treaties, or positions by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration, or interpretation of these tax laws and regulations. These factors, together with the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, and uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any period, can affect our estimates of our effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities, result in changes in our estimates and accruals, and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, or financial condition. We are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business; however, such changes could potentially result in higher tax expense and payments, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of compliance.
Beginning in 2024, many countries have enacted local legislation related to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules, which include the introduction of a 15% global minimum tax. The impact on our income tax expense, which is reflected in the financial statements as a period cost and is not anticipated to be significant, will depend on the exact nature of each countrys GloBE legislation, guidance, and regulations thereon, and their application by tax authorities. Additionally, future enacted GloBE legislation or changes to existing GloBE legislation could impact our anticipated tax burden.
We are subject to periodic tax audits by tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations. As a result, such tax authorities may assess additional tax, interest, and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and other tax disputes to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and establish reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of any tax audit or other tax dispute or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves. As such, the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our business and financial results.
While the majority of our deferred tax assets either do not have an expiration date or are expected to be utilized prior to an expiration date, our ability to fully benefit from these assets could be impacted by the taxable income generated in certain countries over time, subsequent changes to applicable tax laws in these jurisdictions, and our Tax Matters Agreement with GE (see Note 11, Income Taxes and Note 19, Related Parties).
We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and public procurement, as well as policies of our customers on capital spending and government reimbursement and funding in many jurisdictions, as to which the failure to comply with or changes to such laws, regulations, or policies could adversely affect our business. 
29
We have agreements relating to the sale of our offerings to government entities around the world. Additionally, we are directly or indirectly subject to government policies governing reimbursement for healthcare procedures and services. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations in a variety of jurisdictions that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing private contracts, and government contracts may contain terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts or that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. Similarly, most jurisdictions have public procurement laws and reimbursement policies that set out rules and regulations for purchases and reimbursements by governmental entities. These jurisdictions may modify their laws, policies, rules, or regulations, or impose new requirements that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to investigation for non-compliance with the regulations governing government contracts, public procurement, and government reimbursements, when involved in such matters. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts; delayed or reduced payment; criminal, civil, or administrative penalties; contract termination; reputational harm that diminishes our ability to successfully compete for new government work; or debarment. 
Additionally, our customers include hospitals, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, and product and economic cycles, have a significant impact on the capital spending policies of these entities. Impasses in national, regional, or local government budgeting decisions, including as a result of a possible U.S. federal government shutdown, could lead to substantial delays or reductions in governmental spending. Many of our products have lengthy sales and purchase order cycles or are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. As a result, customers may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines or be unable to complete such purchases at all. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
For contracts with the U.S. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable agency rules, the Procurement Integrity Act, the Buy American Act, and/or the Trade Agreements Act. Because the use of our products, services, and solutions is often reimbursed by the U.S. federal government through Medicare and Medicaid, we must comply with the AKS, the Sunshine Act, and the FCA. See 
We are subject to anti-kickback and false claims laws (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our business, including via sanctions and conditions on business activity.
 We must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment and labor practices, supply chain requirements, reporting and disclosure obligations, EH&S matters, recordkeeping, and accounting. Certain countries impose additional requirements on government suppliers as a prerequisite to doing business in the country. These can include, among other things, local headcount requirements, local manufacturing and supplier requirements, and technology or IP transfers.
China has a government-run procurement system for public hospitals to obtain medical devices (mainly high-value medical consumables) and drugs. The system for reimbursing the costs of these medical devices and drugs for patients is also set by the central and local governments. Distribution chains of these medical devices and drugs may be restricted in certain provinces by a policy that requires that at most two tax invoices may be issued throughout the distribution chain, which effectively prohibits sale of products through multi-layer distributors (even between wholly-owned subsidiaries). The continued existence, and any expansion and tightening, of this policy could present significant challenges for our relevant products to reach a larger geographic area in China. Failure to comply with this policy may preclude us from participating in the government-run procurement processes with public hospitals or result in our disqualification from engaging in respective medical device or product sales to public hospitals in a certain locality. These regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs and risks on our business operations for the relevant products.
Additionally, some governmental entities, including the U.S. federal government, can terminate contracts for their convenience or for our default. These governmental entities may also be subject to continued legislative funding approval. Early termination for convenience of one or more of our contracts, or a change in a government customers funding levels, including as a result of a U.S. federal government shutdown, could impact our expected revenues. A termination for default of one or more of our contracts could subject us to penalties and damages resulting from the default, including costs for the governmental entity to reprocure the items under contract, in addition to other penalties previously listed. 
The U.S. federal government could also invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA), requiring that we accept and prioritize contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of loss in revenue incurred on such contracts. In such circumstances, we may be required to reallocate time and resources away from our customers to fulfill U.S. federal government requests under the DPA. This could cause us to be unable to fulfill contractual obligations to non-U.S. federal government customers and harm long-term business relationships with our customers, suppliers, and channel partners, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, we conduct business in many countries outside of the United States and, therefore, could be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by governments of other countries. These laws or regulations could likewise cause us to be unable to fulfill contractual obligations or require us to reallocate time and resources, which could adversely affect our business. 
30
We are also subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. Efforts to ensure our business arrangements comply with applicable laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, defense can be costly and time-consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in certain government healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. We also possess dependencies on governments relative to workforce protocols and customs decisions due to events that are difficult to predict, such as pandemics and regional conflicts. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
We are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims that have been and may be brought against us or as a result of the actions or inactions of our customers or third parties that are outside of our control. 
We design, manufacture, sell, install, and service a wide range of products, including products and related services that are at the cutting edge of existing technologies and medical advances. Our products are used by healthcare providers to diagnose, monitor, and treat a wide range of medical conditions. We are required to comply with the highest quality standards in product manufacturing, and quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our offerings, and ensuring the safety and efficacy of our products. As a result, our business exposes us to potential product liability claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to lawsuits from customers and patients alleging that our products contributed to a personal injury, death, incorrect diagnosis, property damage, and/or that we allegedly did not appropriately warn the customer or patient of potential risks associated with the product. Even if these or similar claims are without merit, they can result in costly and time-consuming litigation. We may also be exposed to claims or regulatory action if our products do not conform or are alleged not to conform to applicable product or design specifications, labeling, or manufacturing requirements. Quality issues could result in warranty, guarantee, or other claims, including with respect to performance guarantees under service contracts. Even if such non-conformance has no actual impact on the quality of our products, we may be exposed to claims, regulatory actions, or negative press reports, or may be required to modify our products or their labeling, conduct a recall, or take other actions, any of which could adversely affect our reputation or our relationships with customers and users of our products. 
Because some of our products, including radiopharmaceuticals, are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may be exposed to radiation, including X-rays, the possibility for significant bodily injury or death exists for the intended or unintended recipient of the delivery. Our products are used to diagnose and treat acutely ill patients and at critical moments in the patient care continuum, and the failure (or alleged failure) of our products to perform as expected in such moments could compromise patient treatment, which, depending on the circumstances, could be life-threatening to patients. 
Product and other liability actions, claims, or injunctions are subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle product liability claims and other liability actions against us, regardless of their actual merit. If such action or injunction were finally determined adversely to us, it could result in significant damages and reputational harm, including the possibility of punitive damages, and our financial position could be adversely affected. Adverse publicity regarding patient outcomes, accidents, failure rates, misdiagnoses, and resulting mistreatment, even ones that do not involve our products, could result in additional regulation of our products or the healthcare industry in general, cause reputational harm, and adversely affect our ability to promote, manufacture, and sell our products, even if the claims against us are later shown to be unfounded or unsubstantiated. 
Moreover, if our products gain a reputation for being unreliable, unsafe, or ineffective, our relationships with governmental authorities may be adversely affected, which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities. In addition, if one of our products is determined to be defective (whether due to design, labeling, or manufacturing defects, or other reasons), or found to be so by a regulatory authority, we may be liable for damages or fines or be required to correct, remove, or recall the product or notify competent regulatory authorities. See 
The U.S. FDA and equivalent global agencies tightly regulate and actively enforce the laws and regulations governing the development, authorization, and commercialization of medical devices and pharmaceutical products.
 The adverse publicity resulting from a recall could damage our reputation and cause customers to review and possibly terminate their relationships with us, potentially beyond the product that was the subject of the action. A correction, removal, or recall could consume management and employee time, and adverse publicity, harm to our reputation, or increased regulatory scrutiny could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
We maintain product liability insurance coverage, among other liability insurance coverage, which includes deductible amounts and self-insured retentions. Our insurance coverage may prove to be inadequate, and future policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all. If a material claim is successfully brought against us relating to a self-insured liability or a liability that is in excess of our insurance coverage, or for which insurance coverage is denied or limited, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, financial position, cash flows, or prospects. Any litigation, 
31
investigation, or complaint and any adverse publicity surrounding such allegations or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Moreover, we may face substantial liability to patients, customers, and others for damages resulting from the faulty, or allegedly faulty, design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing, or interoperability of our products with other products, or their misuse or failure. Our products generally operate within our customers facilities and network systems. Human and other errors or accidents may occur during the operation of our products in complex environments, particularly where our products are used in conjunction with products from other vendors, where interoperability or data sharing protocols may result in unsatisfactory performance even though the equipment operates according to specifications. In addition, independent service organizations could fail to adequately perform their obligations or to properly service our products, which could subject us to further liability. We may also be subject to claims for property damage, economic loss, bodily injury, or death related to or resulting from the installation, servicing, and support of our products. Any accident, mistreatment, or related injury or death could cause us to incur legal costs; subject us to litigation, recall, or regulatory enforcement actions; or generate negative publicity and cause damage to our reputation, whether or not we or our products were at fault, and could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
We may become involved in litigation, arbitration, and governmental proceedings, including those stemming from third-party conduct beyond our control. 
We are involved in, or threatened with, legal, arbitration, and governmental proceedings or investigations from time to time in the ordinary course of our business as well as heightened scrutiny in the healthcare industry, including disputes with employees, competitors, customers, suppliers, channel partners, competition authorities, regulators, other authorities, purported whistle-blowers, or regulatory agencies concerning allegations of, among other things, breaches of contract, product liability, product defects, IP infringement, logistics or manufacturing related topics, quality regulations, EH&S or employment issues, termination of business relationship, or alleged or suspected violations of applicable laws in various jurisdictions. The outcome of pending or potential future legal, arbitration, and governmental proceedings is difficult to predict, and excessive verdicts do occur. If such proceedings are determined adversely to us, we may be required to change our business practices or we may incur fines, penalties, or monetary losses, some of which may be significant or could disrupt the operation of our business. Exposure to litigation or other government action, whether directed at us; our customers, suppliers, or channel partners; or our or their respective business partners, could also result in the distraction of management resources and adversely affect our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Like other companies in our industry, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies around the world. As a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. Criminal charges and substantial fines or civil penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from government investigations.
Developments following regulatory authorization, including results in post-approval device or pharmaceutical Phase 4 trials or other studies, could adversely affect sales or decrease demand for our medical devices or pharmaceutical products. 
As a condition to granting marketing authorization of a medical device or pharmaceutical product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials or surveillance studies. The outcomes of these post-market trials could result in the loss of marketing authorization, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about the safety or efficacy of a product. Regulatory agencies in countries outside of the United States often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others, and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial potential of the affected products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in updated labeling, restrictions on use, product withdrawal, or recall. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. 
Our certificate of incorporation provides that certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 
Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent, or stockholder to us or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation, or the bylaws; or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such action, the action may be brought in another court of the State of Delaware or, if no court of the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, then in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation states that the foregoing provision will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of 
32
America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provisions will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. There is, however, uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum provisions, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. The choice of forum provision may result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. Further, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.
RISKS RELATING TO FINANCING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES.
Complying with our requirements under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
We have $8,951 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our existing debt, together with any additional indebtedness that we may incur, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends, or repurchase our common stock.
The debt instruments that comprise our indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations, financings, or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, a substantial portion of our total consolidated cash is held overseas and may not be efficiently accessible to fund our debt obligations, which are primarily held in the United States.
We have significant postretirement benefit liabilities, including pension, healthcare, and life insurance benefit obligations, and the actual costs and related cash flows of these obligations are uncertain and could exceed current estimates.
These net liabilities arise under multiple retirement benefit plans and statutory obligations in various countries. Most of the liabilities arise under pension plans, including defined benefit pension plans, either funded with plan assets (partially or fully) or unfunded. Increases in pension, healthcare, and life insurance benefit obligations and costs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase in equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to financial market volatility, and future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can adversely impact our financial results and financial condition. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, accounting standards and legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in applicable legislation, regulations, or case law. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur new or more extensive pension obligations in the future due to such changes. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
33
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices, and interest rates, and unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets could adversely affect our financial performance. 
We generate the majority of our revenue outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (USD) could adversely affect our financial results. As of the year ended December 31, 2024, our largest currency exposures are the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Norwegian Krone, and British Pound Sterling. Revenues and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into USD for financial reporting purposes, and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the USD impact reported earnings. In addition, our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the USD, which could result in exchange gains or losses from revaluation. We also face foreign exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Furthermore, foreign exchange hedging activities do not offer permanent or comprehensive protection, appropriate hedging instruments may not always be available or may be prohibitively costly, or we might not be successful in effectively mitigating such exposures. 
Equity prices can be volatile. The prices of our common stock and equity investments have fluctuated and could fluctuate in the future, which could impact the long-term performance of the investments we hold, the value of equity compensation awards we grant, the value of plan assets held in our pension plans, and, as a result, our financial performance.
We are also exposed to volatility due to changes in interest rates, which primarily impacts our borrowings, postretirement assets and liabilities, and investments. Changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of our fixed interest rate borrowings, the cash flows associated with our variable interest rate borrowings, and the valuation of our postretirement assets and liabilities, which may directly or indirectly impact our earnings or our cash flows, and the cash flows associated with our investments. Refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further information.  
Additionally, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, acquisitions, and the need to refinance existing debt. Our exposure to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable. This could impact our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms. Furthermore, changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements. As a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow, including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments.
Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could adversely affect our business. 
We review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill, and property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), for impairment at least annually. All long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction, or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
GENERAL RISKS. 
Certain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in GE or because of their previous or continuing positions with GE. 
Because of their current or former positions with GE, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in both us and GE. Continuing ownership of GE shares and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and GE face decisions that could have implications for both us and GE. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and GE regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Spin-Off and our relationship with GE. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or GE may enter into in the future. 
Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and limit the power of our stockholders. 
Several provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, provisions that (1) establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals; (2) limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent; (3) provide the Board the right to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and (4) provide for the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on the Board (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board). In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that stockholders may favor.
34
These and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law, as well as the restrictions in our Tax Matters Agreement, may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of GE HealthCare, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. Our Board believes these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the Board and by providing the Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the Board determines is not in our and our stockholders best interests. 
We or GE may fail to perform under various transaction agreements executed as part of the Spin-Off. 
In connection with the Spin-Off, we and GE entered into various transaction agreements related to the Spin-Off. These agreements govern our relationship with GE and we rely on GE to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If we or GE do not satisfy our respective obligations under these agreements, including indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT.
GE HealthCare employs practices, processes, and procedures to proactively and comprehensively manage risks, including risks related to cybersecurity, through its 
enterprise risk management (ERM) program
. We aim to identify material cybersecurity risks via multiple strategies, including user and external reporting, audit and assessment activities, and technology programs. We utilize risk identification and risk mitigation strategies.

Risk identification begins with understanding the devices and equipment in use across the company, including laptops and other data devices, industrial equipment and machinery, and associated risks related to the use of those devices and equipment.

Risk mitigation entails protecting our data and operational systems via a system of controls. We monitor and collect data about the devices and users that touch our network resources, reviewing this data for anomalies. When we identify anomalies, we investigate to determine if the anomaly represents a threat. We have a process to contain and remediate identified threats. As discussed further below, we have incident response processes in place to utilize in case of threats or incidents. We conduct regular crisis simulations.
Our processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of 
third-party service providers
, including those in our supply chain or who have access to our customer and employee data or our systems. Third-party risks are included within our ERM assessment program as well as our cybersecurity-specific risk identification program, as discussed above. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform diligence on third parties that have access to our systems, data, or facilities that house such systems or data, and monitor cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence. 
We have a dedicated team of cyber professionals who report to our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). This team publishes information technology and security policies, measures compliance, and operates a program to mitigate risks and threats. Our risk mitigation activities include network segmentation, cyber protection and containment, detection and reaction, and recovery. This team operates to decrease the risk of cyber incidents having a material impact. We measure our programs against the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and regularly test our controls and incident response plans.
We maintain incident response plans that guide our activities in preparing for, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. These plans cover the range of activities we undertake in connection with responding to cybersecurity incidents, including assessment, investigation, containment, remediation, and mitigation, as well as compliance with legal obligations including any necessary regulatory reporting. 
As part of these processes, we regularly engage with assessors, consultants, auditors, and other 
third parties to review our cybersecurity program to help identify areas for continued focus, improvement, and compliance
.
35
To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our security measures, there can be no assurance that the Company, or the third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that may materially affect us.
 We describe whether and how cybersecurity-related risks could materially affect our business in item 1A. Risk Factors under the heading 
Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber crimes pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services, and data, as well as our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.
 
CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE.
Cybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. 
The 
Audit Committee
 of our Board is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity-related risks.
 
The Audit Committee regularly receives reports from management on our cybersecurity threat risk management and strategy processes, including on topics such as our data security posture, results from third-party assessments, progress towards pre-determined risk-mitigation-related goals, incident response plans, and cybersecurity threat risks or incidents and developments, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to these risks.
 The Audit Committee received reports from our Chief Information Officer (CIO) and/or CISO five times in 2024.
Our cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above, are led by our 
CISO
. 
The CISO works closely with the CIO, Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and other members of the legal team who report to the General Counsel, to review the cybersecurity program while monitoring global data protection regulations and cyber security laws.
 
The CISO, CIO, and CPO, collectively, have over 35 years of work experience in various roles involving managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, and implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs. Our CISO is currently a board member for the National Technology Security Coalition, a non-profit, non-partisan trade association serving as the voice of CISOs to help improve national cybersecurity and has served on the board of advisors of many security technology companies.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
GE HealthCare is a global organization with major centers in or near Chicago, Milwaukee, Paris, Bangalore, and Shanghai, and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. We own or lease over 300 facilities around the world excluding third-party logistics sites. We have 43 manufacturing facilities, of which 30 are owned. We have 15 manufacturing facilities located in the United States and 28 located outside of the United States, including in China, India, Israel, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, South Korea, and Japan. Many of these facilities serve more than one business line and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, research, manufacturing, warehousing, service, and distribution. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Information on material pending legal proceedings is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth in Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Not applicable.
PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and corresponding notes (the financial statements) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis provide information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial results of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (GE HealthCare, the Company, our, us, or we) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances; see Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and particularly in Item 1A,
 
Risk Factors.
On January 3, 2023, the General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (GE), completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the Spin-Off). For further information regarding the Spin-Off, refer to Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation.
The following tables are presented in millions of United States (U.S.) dollars unless otherwise stated, except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts, and unless otherwise stated, represent changes year-over-year.
Effective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies, previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment to better match its clinical usage and realize stronger business and customer impact by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions (AVS). Following this realignment, the Company continues to have four reportable segments: Imaging, Advanced Visualization Solutions, Patient Care Solutions (PCS), and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx). These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products sold and how the Company manages its operations. Historical segment financial information presented within this report has been recast to conform to the new reportable segments structure. For additional information on the nature of our business and our segments, refer to Item 1, Business and Note 4, Segment and Geographical Information.
TRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and particularly in Item 1A,
 
Risk Factors.
KEY TRENDS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Russia and Ukraine Conflict
We had $162 million and $153 million of assets in, or directly related to, Russia and Ukraine as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, none of which are subject to sanctions that impact the carrying value of the assets. We generated revenues of $363 million, $340 million, and $395 million from customers in these two countries for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The potential inability to repatriate earnings from these two countries will not have a material impact on our ability to operate.
We continue to monitor the effects of Russias invasion of Ukraine, including the consideration of financial impact, cybersecurity risks, the applicability and effect of sanctions, and the employee base in Ukraine and Russia. Under the current U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, we are permitted to export, re-export, or transfer medical equipment and spare parts that meet stated criteria under a License Exception, which has eliminated the need for us to obtain individual U.S. licenses in most cases; however, licenses still may be needed for some transactions. The European Union and other countries have also expanded licensing requirements for certain spare parts, services, software, and other items. We will continue to apply for licenses to supply to these customers and to support our business in Russia, as required. The implementation of these measures affected our ability to supply customers in Russia during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and will continue to do so as we confirm applicability of the U.S. License Exception to our transactions and continue to obtain licenses. There is no guarantee we will obtain all of the licenses for which we applied, that any approvals we obtain will be on a timely basis, or that our business in Russia will not be further disrupted due to evolving legal or operational considerations. The Board, together with management, will continue to assess whether developments related to the conflict have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the Company.
39
China Market
We continue to monitor developments in the market in China. In March 2024, the government in China announced a new stimulus program (2024 stimulus) that includes the healthcare sector and is being implemented through Chinas provinces. In addition, an anti-corruption campaign directed at the healthcare sector remains ongoing. Both of these factors contributed to delayed orders and sales in our China business throughout 2024. We expect the 2024 stimulus program will result in opportunities for our business in China in the longer term, but it has had a short-term impact as provinces develop and announce their plans and customers begin to make purchasing decisions. We expect the effects of the delay in the 2024 stimulus and the anti-corruption campaign to continue to impact our orders and sales in the near term, although we are unable to predict the exact duration or magnitude of the impact. We expect both of these impacts to be temporary, and we believe the focus of government policy in China on expanding access to healthcare will benefit our business in China in the long term.
Tariffs
In February 2025, the United States imposed additional tariffs on products from China. These tariffs, and any future tariffs, including on products from Mexico or Canada, by the United States or other countries, will likely result in additional costs to us. The impact of tariffs will depend on various factors including the timing, amount, scope, and nature of the tariffs, and any mitigating actions we implement.
Tax Valuation Allowances
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by evaluating all available positive and negative evidence. We have a valuation allowance against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets and will release the valuation allowance when there is sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, Income Taxes.
Seasonality
Our revenues and operating profits vary from quarter to quarter. Financial results in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than in other quarters due to the spending patterns of our customers. 
OPERATION AS A STAND-ALONE COMPANY. 
Financial Presentation Under GE Ownership
GE HealthCare utilized allocations and carve-out methodologies through the date of the Spin-Off to prepare historical combined financial statements. The combined financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of our future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred by us, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the historical periods presented. For additional information, see Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation.
Stand-Alone Company Expenses 
As a result of the Spin-Off, we are subject to federal and state securities laws and stock exchange requirements. We have established additional procedures and practices as a stand-alone public company. As a result, we have and will continue to incur additional costs related to external reporting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, Board of 
Directors and officers, and stock administration. 
Compensation 
We have instituted competitive compensation policies and programs as an independent public company. The expense for these policies and programs increased from the compensation expense allocated by GE in years prior to the Spin-Off, driven primarily by higher cash and stock compensation to retain employees and align more closely with industry peers.
SUMMARY OF KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Management reviews and analyzes several key performance measures including Total revenues, Operating income, Net income attributable to GE HealthCare, Earnings per share, and Cash from (used for) operating activities. Management also reviews and analyzes Organic revenue*, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes* (Adjusted EBIT*), Adjusted net income*, Adjusted tax expense*, Adjusted effective tax rate* (Adjusted ETR*), Adjusted earnings per share*, and Free cash flow*, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reviewed and analyzed in order to evaluate our business performance, identify trends affecting our business, allocate capital, and make strategic decisions, including those discussed below. See Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion on our key performance measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures, a discussion of why we believe they are useful to management and investors as well as certain of their limitations, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided below under Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

For the year ended December 31, 2024
Total revenues were $19,672 million
, 
growing 1% or $120 million
. The reported growth was largely due to Sales of services increasing 
3%
 or $
172
 million primarily driven by increased pricing.
The segment revenues were as follows:

Imaging segment revenues were $8,855 million, decreasing 1% or $89 million, following high single-digit revenue growth in the prior year, with current year impacts from lower sales volume in China and unfavorable foreign currency impacts;

AVS segment revenues were $5,131 million, growing 1% or $37 million with an increase in sales volume in USCAN partially offset by lower sales volume in China and unfavorable foreign currency impacts;

PCS segment revenues were $3,125 million, decreasing 1% or $17 million primarily due to decreased volume in the Monitoring Solutions product line following growth in the prior year and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by increased volume in the Maternal Infant Care product line; and

PDx segment revenues were $2,508 million, growing 9% or $202 million with growth in the USCAN and EMEA regions driven by growth in volume, an increase in price, and new product introductions.
The regional revenues were as follows:

USCAN revenues were $8,981 million, growing 5% or $430 million with growth across all segment revenues;

EMEA revenues were $5,051 million, flat to the prior year, following high single-digit growth in the prior year, with growth in PDx revenues largely offset by decreases in Imaging and PCS revenues;

China region revenues were $2,360 million, decreasing 15% or $425 million with declines in all segment revenues following double-digit growth in the prior year due to the impact from the 2022 COVID stimulus programs, and current year sales impacted by the delayed 2024 stimulus and the ongoing anti-corruption campaign; and

Rest of World revenues were $3,280 million, growing 4% or $122 million with growth in all segment revenues, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
For the year ended December 31, 2023
Total revenues were $19,552 million
, growing 7% or $1,211 million as reported and 8% organically*. The reported growth was primarily due to Sales of products growing 9% or $1,083 million as reported, with growth across all segments.
The segment revenues were as follows:

Imaging segment revenues were $8,944 million, growing 7% or $549 million as reported due to an increase in Organic revenue*, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue* grew 8% primarily due to growth in Magnetic Resonance and MI/CT product lines, due to supply chain fulfillment improvements, new product introductions, and an increase in price;

AVS segment revenues were $5,094 million, growing 2% or $82 million as reported due to an increase in Organic revenue*, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue* grew 3% primarily due to growth in the CardioVascular and Interventional Solutions product line due to new product introductions, an increase in price, and supply chain fulfillment improvements;

PCS segment revenues were $3,142 million, growing 8% or $226 million due to growth in Monitoring Solutions and Consumables and Services product lines driven by an increase in price and operational improvements; and

PDx segment revenues were $2,306 million, growing 18% or $348 million with growth across all regions due to an increase in price and improved demand.
The regional revenues were as follows:

USCAN revenues were $8,551 million, growing 5% or $421 million due to growth in PCS, PDX, and Imaging revenues;

EMEA revenues were $5,058 million, growing 8% or $374 million due to growth in Imaging and PDx revenues;

China region revenues were $2,785 million, growing 10% or $254 million due to growth across all segment revenues, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts; and

For the year ended December 31, 2024
Operating income was $2,625 million, an increase of $190 million and 90 basis points as a percent of Total revenues. The increase was due to the following factors: 

Gross profit increased $283 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Total revenues primarily due to a reduction in Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold decreased $194 million or 120 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity, favorable mix within our product offerings, and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold increased $31 million but decreased 80 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $405 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $438 million for the 
prior year comparable period
; and

Total operating expenses increased $93 million, with an increase in R&D investments of $106 million and a decrease in Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense of $13 million primarily driven by cost saving initiatives, including information technology, largely offset by increased restructuring spend. As a result, R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 50 basis points and SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues decreased by 20 basis points.
Net income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,993 million and 10.1%, an increase of $425 million and 210 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:

Operating income increased $190 million, as discussed above;

Interest and other financial charges  net decreased $38 million primarily driven by repayments made on the Term Loan Facility;

Non-operating benefit income increased $24 million primarily related to the amortization of net gains on our pension plans;

Other income  net decreased $31 million primarily driven by favorable impacts from Net financing and investment income in the prior year driven by impacts from the revaluation of investments; and

Provision for income taxes decreased $212 million primarily due to the release of the France valuation allowance partially offset by the establishment of a reserve for ongoing audits in France. In the prior year, there were larger non-recurring impacts from the Tax Matters Agreement with GE as well as an incremental charge for the accrual of withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, Income Taxes.
Adjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $3,211 million and 16.3%, an increase of $255 million and 120 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Gross profit, partially offset by investment in R&D.
Adjusted net income*
 
was $2,060 million, an increase of $263 million primarily due to an increase in Gross profit and lower Interest and other financial charges  net, partially offset by investment in R&D.

For the year ended December 31, 2023
Operating income was $2,435 million, a decrease of $87 million and 130 basis points as a percent of Total revenues. The decrease as a percent of Total revenues was due to the following factors:

Cost of products sold increased $490 million but decreased 170 basis points as a percent of Sales of products. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our products, partially offset by cost inflation. Cost of services sold decreased $22 million or 130 basis points as a percent of Sales of services. The decrease as a percent of sales was driven by cost productivity and an increase in pricing of our service offerings, partially offset by cost inflation. Included in our total cost of revenue as part of our product investment was $438 million in engineering costs for design follow-through on new product introductions and product lifecycle maintenance subsequent to the initial product launch, compared to $429 million for the 
prior year comparable period
; and

Total operating expenses increased $830 million due to an increase in SG&A expense of $651 million driven by increased costs associated with both the one-time stand-up and recurring operations of a stand-alone company and commercial and marketing investments and an increase in R&D investments of $179 million. As a result, SG&A as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 210 basis points and R&D as a percentage of Total revenues increased by 60 basis points.
Net income attributable to GE HealthCare and Net income margin were $1,568 million and 8.0%, a decrease of $348 million and 240 basis points, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:

Operating income decreased $87 million, as discussed above;

Interest and other financial charges  net increased $465 million primarily due to interest expense related to the debt securities issued by GE HealthCare in November of 2022 and the Term Loan Facility drawn upon in January of 2023;

Non-operating benefit income increased $377 million primarily related to the pension plans transferred to GE HealthCare as part of the Spin-Off; and

Provision for income taxes increased $180 million primarily due to t
he tax effect of foreign currency movement, the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement, including the effect of completing the 2022 U.S. federal tax return
, taxes accrued for the future repatriation of current earnings with a one-time charge for prior period earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to stand-alone GE HealthCare tax rates. For additional detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11, Income Taxes.
Adjusted EBIT* and Adjusted EBIT margin* were $2,956 million and 15.1%, an increase of $95 million but a decrease of 50 basis points, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Total revenues, offset by an increase in Total operating expenses, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.
Adjusted net income*
 
was $1,797 million, a decrease of $306 million primarily due to higher Interest and other financial charges  net, partially offset by an increase in Operating Income, excluding the impact of one-time Spin-Off and separation costs, as discussed above.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 SEGMENTS
We exclude from Segment EBIT certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our Chief Operating Decision Maker (which is our Chief Executive Officer) considers to be non-operational, such as Interest and other financial charges  net, Benefit (provision) for income taxes, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), Spin-Off and separation costs, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and investment revaluation gain (loss).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are supplemental measures of our performance and our liquidity that we believe will help investors understand our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results, and assess our future prospects. When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for making financial, operational, and planning decisions. Descriptions of the reported non-GAAP measures are included below.
We report Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate to provide management and investors with additional understanding and visibility into the underlying revenue trends of our established, ongoing operations, as well as provide insights into overall demand for our products and services. To calculate these measures, we exclude the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
We report EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings per share to provide management and investors with additional understanding of our business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors, on a normalized basis. To calculate these measures we exclude, and reflect in the detailed reconciliations below, the following adjustments as applicable: Interest and other financial charges 

 net, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, Benefit (provision) for income taxes and certain tax related adjustments, and certain non-recurring and/or non-cash items. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted EBIT margin is calculated by taking Adjusted EBIT divided by Total revenues for the same period.
We report Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted ETR to provide management and investors with a better understanding of the normalized tax rate applicable to our business and provide more consistent comparability across periods. A
djusted tax expense excludes the income tax related to the pre-tax income adjustments included as part of Adjusted net income and certain income tax adjustments, such as adjustments to deferred tax assets or liabilities. We may from time to time consider excluding other non-recurring tax items to enhance comparability between periods. Adjusted ETR is Adjusted tax expense divided by income before income taxes less the pre-tax income adjustments referenced above.
We report Free cash flow to provide management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis and provide insight into our flexibility to allocate capital
. Free cash flow is Cash from (used for) operating activities  continuing operations including cash flows related to the additions and dispositions of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and additions of internal-use software.
 Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the capital required for debt repayments.
Management recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes. In order to compensate for the discussed limitations, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are provided below, and no single financial measure should be relied on to evaluate our business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2024, our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position was $2,889 million. We have historically generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, we have access to revolving credit facilities of $3,500 million in aggregate, described in detail in Note 9, Borrowings.
We believe that our existing balance of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, future cash generated from operating activities, access to capital markets, and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our current and ongoing operations, pay taxes due, service our existing debt, and fund investments in our business for at least the next 12 months.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing capacity expansion, new product introductions, and equipment and tooling for new and existing products.
Material Cash Requirements
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under lease, debt, and other commitments are provided in Note 7, Leases, Note 9, Borrowings, and Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies. We have material cash requirements related to our pension obligations as described in Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans.
Debt and Credit Facilities
Additional information on our debt and credit facilities, including definitions of the terms used below, is included in 
Note 9
, 
Borrowings. 
As part of our capital structure, we have incurred debt. The servicing of this debt is supported by cash flows from our operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had $8,951 million of total debt compared to $9,442 million as of December 31, 2023
. This includes a 
$1,000 million a
ggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by the Company in the third quarter of 2024, and a repayment in the fourth quarter of 2024 of 
$1,000 million
 of senior unsecured notes. 
The decrease in debt was due primarily to repayments of 
$150 million
 and 
$250 million
 of the outstanding Term Loan Facility in the first and fourth quarter of 2024, respectively.
The weighted average interest rate for the Notes and our Credit Facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 5.99%.
In addition to the Term Loan Facility, our credit facilities include a five-year senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $2,500 million expiring in January 2028, and a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility that provides borrowings of up to $1,000 million expiring in December 2025. As of 
December 31, 2024
, there were no outstanding borrowings on either of the two revolving facilities.
The Credit Facilities include various customary covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens securing debt, the entry into certain fundamental change transactions by GE HealthCare, and the maximum permitted leverage ratio. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements, including the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. 
Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
In connection with the Spin-Off, we accessed the capital markets and raised $10,250 million of debt by issuing 
$8,250 million
 of senior unsecured notes in November 2022, completed a drawdown of the Term Loan Facility of 
$2,000 million
 in January 2023, and arranged $3,500 million of revolving credit facilities to further support our liquidity needs. In the third quarter of 2024, we issued 
$1,000 million
 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2029. We plan to continue to rely on capital markets, and we expect to have access to credit facilities to fund our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing will be influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions. Moody

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
To prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require managements judgment: Revenue Recognition, Business Combination Related Measurements, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Income Taxes. 
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information on our significant accounting policies.
REVENUE RECOGNITION.
Our revenues are recorded based on the consideration specified in customer contracts net of any sales incentives, discounts, returns, chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees, rebates, or credits, which are accounted for as estimated variable consideration. Our estimates for these deductions are based upon historical experience and consider current and forecasted market trends. We record the estimated amounts as a reduction to revenue when we recognize the related product or service sale. 
Chargebacks are a form of variable consideration that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the contracted customer. A provision for outstanding chargebacks is recorded at the time we recognize revenue from the sale to the wholesaler and requires certain estimates such as the wholesaler chargeback rates, the expected sell-through levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. 
The amounts of variable consideration included in the net transaction price for revenue recognition are limited to the amounts that are estimated to be probable of occurrence to avoid a material revenue reversal in a future period. 
See Note 3, Revenue Recognition for further information on revenue recognition and Note 5, Receivables for further information on chargebacks.
BUSINESS COMBINATION RELATED MEASUREMENTS. 
Our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the combination. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration we may be liable to pay in the future, are recorded on the date of the business combination at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Our business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense. The fair values of acquired intangible assets and liabilities are determined using information available at the business combination date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable. Significant assumptions vary by the class of asset or liability and the valuation technique used. These assumptions can include: the discount rates; timing; probability of achieving regulatory and commercialization milestones; and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, growth rates, royalty rates, and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage third-party valuation specialists who review our critical assumptions and prepare the calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant business combinations.
52
See Note 8, Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets for further information on our business combinations.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.
 
Pension and other postretirement benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and related asset and liability measurement. The Company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. The Company periodically evaluates other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and updates them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. 
Projected benefit obligations (PBO) are measured as the present value of expected payments. We discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the expected timing of benefit payments. 
A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2025 and PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) as of December 31, 2024:

The sensitivity of the net deficit to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plans asset allocation.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields, and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also consider expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations. A 1% change in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the 2025 net periodic benefit costs of these plans by $194 million.
Our pension plan assets contain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. While the majority of these assets are valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets, the fair value of certain assets is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These assets primarily relate to real estate and private equity investments.
For pension benefits and retiree health and life benefits transferred from GE on January 1, 2023, third-party actuaries were engaged to assist in the valuation of transferred pension assets and liabilities using assumptions provided by GE which the Company reviewed prior to recording amounts in our combined financial statements.
We disclose in the following table postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $50 million as of December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans for further details related to these plans. The value of the assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, are summarized in the table below.

INCOME TAXES.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, GE HealthCare is included in the combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns of GE, where eligible. However, we have adopted the separate return method for purposes of our combined financial statements. The income tax provisions reflected in our combined financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022 have been estimated as if we were a separate taxpayer. 
Our annual tax expense is based on our income, applicable statutory tax rates, and tax incentives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly impact the estimate of our tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years to the extent applicable, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates; we use our historical experience as well as our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the change in the technical merit of a position, or an uncertain tax position is effectively settled with the relevant taxing authority, or the statute of limitations has expired. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these changes; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. 
See Note 11, Income Taxes for further information on income taxes.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, and equity prices, which may impact future income, cash flows, and fair value of our business. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations, or the fair value interest rate risk of our financial instruments bearing fixed interest by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of such risks. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative contracts to the extent they meet the objectives described above, and not for speculative purposes. See Note 13, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.
As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses, including those arising from intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign operations creating exposure to foreign currency translation risk. Such principal currencies include the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen, the Norwegian Krone, and the British Pound Sterling, among others. Operating entities with functional currencies other than the USD also create exposure to foreign currency risk realized upon their sale or a complete or substantially complete liquidation.
We use a number of techniques to manage the effects of foreign currency exchange risk, including hedging of significant currency exposures. We use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts and economic hedges when we have exposures to foreign currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting. We use net investment hedging to hedge the foreign currency risk of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates against the USD. As a result of the above mitigating activities, we have been able to significantly reduce the financial impact of volatility from currency fluctuations.
The potential decrease in fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts from a 10% decrease in USD spot rates against other applicable currencies would have been $82 million as of December 31, 2024. This excludes foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges as changes in the fair value of those contracts are not expected to impact earnings. The sensitivity analysis assumes a uniform weakening of USD spot rates against the other applicable currencies, compared to the actual exchange rates applied as of December 31, 2024, with all other factors remaining constant. This sensitivity analysis disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged currency exposures in earnings.
54
The effect arising from foreign currency transactions, including the remeasurement of derivatives mentioned above, can result in significant fluctuations at points in time, but generally will be offset as the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. The global nature of our customer base and manufacturing footprint allows for the natural offset of certain income and costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
INTEREST RATE RISK.
We are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to the fair value of our borrowings bearing fixed interest rates and variability of cash flows related to our investments and borrowings bearing variable interest rates.
As of December 31, 2024, we have $8,250 million of fixed-rate debt and $750 million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility which carries a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2024, we have $2,889 million of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, of which $1,885 million is invested in short-term investments that generate income based on variable interest rates.
A change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and would impact our earnings and cash flows associated with our floating-rate debt. A hypothetical change of interest rates by 100 basis points would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $35 million, partially offset by the change in interest income from our cash investments.
We primarily manage interest rate risk by using a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, we executed an aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap contracts to synthetically convert $2,700 million of our senior unsecured notes from fixed rates to variable rates as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
COMMODITY RISK.
We rely upon supplies of certain raw materials including helium, iodine, and rare earth minerals. Worldwide demand, availability, and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future. If supply of these materials is restricted or if prices increase, this could constrain our manufacturing of affected products, reduce our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers, and patients who may rely on our products.
Similarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility. If the costs of certain commodities or of energy, shipping, or transportation increase and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Disruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities (including as a result of war, natural disasters, climate change-related physical and transitional risks, actual or threatened public health emergencies, or other business continuity events) adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. 
We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from commodity price fluctuations. The impact of commodity hedges is recognized in earnings in the applicable current period.
EQUITY RISK.
As of December 31, 2024, we have $260 million of deferred compensation liabilities subject to the risk of changes in equity prices. A change in the U.S equity markets would result in a corresponding change in the value of these deferred compensation liabilities, which would impact our earnings and cash flows. We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions to reduce the impact to earnings from equity price fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of GE HealthCare Technologies, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of GE HealthCare Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated and combined statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income Taxes  Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets  Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for tax attributes and for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies.
The Companys determination of the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets involves judgments and estimates, including the projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income. Auditing managements projected timing and pattern of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the projection of future sources of taxable income, which affect the recorded valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.
57
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
With the assistance of our income tax specialists, our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize certain net deferred tax assets included the following, among others: 

We considered relevant tax laws and regulations in evaluating the appropriateness of managements estimates of future sources of taxable income.

We evaluated the reasonableness of managements estimates of future sources of taxable income by comparing the estimates to historical sources of taxable income or loss.

We evaluated managements projected timing and projected pattern of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.

We evaluated whether the estimated future sources of taxable income were of the appropriate character to utilize the deferred tax assets under tax law.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
58
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. 
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
ORGANIZATION.
GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries (GE HealthCare, the Company, our, us, or we) is a trusted partner and leading global healthcare solutions provider, innovating medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and integrated, cloud-first AI-enabled solutions, services, and data analytics. We operate at the center of the healthcare ecosystem, helping enable precision care by increasing health system capacity, enhancing productivity, digitizing healthcare delivery, and improving clinical outcomes while serving patients demand for greater efficiency, access, and personalized medicine. Our products, services, and solutions are designed to enable clinicians to make more informed decisions quickly and efficiently, improving patient care from screening and diagnosis to therapy and monitoring. 
On January 3, 2023, the General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (GE), completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the Spin-Off). The Spin-Off was completed through a distribution of approximately 
80.1
% of the Companys outstanding common stock to holders of record of GEs common stock as of the close of business on December 16, 2022 (the Distribution), which resulted in the issuance of approximately 
454
 million shares of common stock. Prior to the Distribution, the Company issued 
100
 shares of common stock in exchange for $
1.00
, all of which were held by GE as of December 31, 2022. As a result of the Distribution, the Company became an independent public company. On April 2, 2024, GE completed the separation of its GE Vernova business into an independent publicly traded company. In the fourth quarter of 2024, GE sold its remaining ownership of the Companys outstanding common stock. Following the share sell-down, GE continues to be reported as a related party due to the nature of our relationship and board member affiliation.
In connection with the Spin-Off, certain adjustments were recorded to reflect transfers from GE, the draw-down of the Term Loan Facility, and settlement of Spin-Off transactions with GE, which resulted in the net reduction in Total equity of $
2,849
 million. These items substantially consisted of the transfer of: (1) certain pension plan liabilities and assets as described in Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans, (2) certain deferred income taxes as described in Note 11, Income Taxes, (3) deferred compensation liabilities of $
548
 million, and (4) employee termination obligations as described in Note 15, Restructuring Activities.
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into or adopted several agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and GE. See Note 19, Related Parties and Transition Services Agreement for more information on these agreements and related transactions.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to GE HealthCare, we, us, our, and the Company refer to (1) GEs healthcare business prior to the Spin-Off as a carve-out business of GE with related combined financial statements and (2) GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off with related consolidated financial statements.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION.
The consolidated and combined financial statements and corresponding notes (the financial statements) have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Companys financial position and operating results have been included. All intercompany balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated in the financial statements. Tables throughout this document are presented in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated and certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, which was prior to the Spin-Off, the combined financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of GE, including the historical cost basis of assets and liabilities comprising the Company, as well as the historical revenues, direct costs, and allocations of indirect costs attributable to the operations of the Company, using the historical accounting policies applied by GE. The combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), financial position, or cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity prior to the Spin-Off.
Certain prior year amounts in the financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, which provides additional detail to readers of the financial statements. Amounts related to current compensation and benefit obligations that were previously reported within the All other current liabilities and All other operating activities  net lines on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, have been reclassified to separate lines on the respective financial statements. Additionally on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows, amounts related to purchase of investments previously reported within All other investing activities  net, and amounts related to equity award activity previously reported within All other financing activities  net, have been reclassified to separate lines.

Effective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies (IGT), previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment to better match its clinical usage and realize stronger business and customer impact by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions (AVS). Following this realignment, the Company continues to have 
four
 reportable segments: Imaging, AVS, Patient Care Solutions (PCS), and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx). These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products sold and how the Company manages its operations. Historical segment financial information presented within this report has been recast to conform to the new reportable segments structure.
NOTE 2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions, which affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: revenue from contracts with customers; recoverability of long-lived assets and inventory; valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; useful lives used in depreciation and amortization; asset retirement obligations; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies including legal and product warranties; actuarial assumptions used to determine costs of pension and other postretirement benefits; valuation of pension assets; valuation and recoverability of receivables; valuation of derivatives; and valuation of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration as a result of acquisitions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. 
Our revenues primarily consist of sales of products and services to customers. Products include equipment, imaging agents, software-related offerings, and upgrades. Services include contractual and stand-by preventative maintenance and corrective services, as well as related parts and labor, extended warranties, training, and other service-type offerings. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers when the customer obtains control of the underlying products or services.
The Company recognizes a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable agreement between the Company and its customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. The Companys revenues are measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with each customer net of any sales incentives, discounts, returns, chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees, rebates, or credits, as well as taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities. Our estimates for these deductions, which are accounted for as variable consideration, are based on historical experience and consider current and forecasted market trends. We record these estimated amounts as a reduction to revenue when we recognize the related product or service sales. Payment terms are generally within 12 months. Payment terms within 12 months are not treated as significant financing components.
Contracts for the sale of products and services often include multiple distinct performance obligations, usually involving an upfront deliverable of equipment and future performance obligations such as installation, training, or the future delivery of products or services. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling price. Stand-alone selling price is obtained from sources such as the separate selling price for that or a similar item if reasonably available. If such evidence is not reasonably available, we use our best estimate of selling price, which is established consistent with the pricing strategy of the Company and considers product configuration, geography, customer type, and other market-specific factors. 
Revenue is recognized in the period in which the customer obtains control of the underlying products or services, allowing them the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of, the remaining benefits of such product or service. This may occur at a point in time or over time. Shipping and handling costs to deliver products to customers are expensed as incurred and recognized within Cost of products or Cost of services in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. 
For standard, assurance-type warranties that are provided with products, we estimate the cost that may be incurred during the warranty period and record a liability at the time the revenue is recognized. The provision recorded reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred related to the products sold. Service-type warranties or extended warranties sold with products are considered separate performance obligations. As such, a portion of the overall transaction price is allocated to these performance obligations and recognized in revenue over time, as the performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company capitalizes certain direct incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract, primarily commissions. Costs to obtain a contract are classified within Contract and other deferred assets or All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are recognized based on the timing of when the Company expects to earn related revenues. Management assesses these costs for impairment based on periodic assessments of recoverability. 
66
Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time 
We primarily recognize revenue from sales of products at the point in time that the customer obtains control, which is 
generally 
no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. Where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on customer-specified criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the 
products, which is typically at the point of acceptance
. Our billing terms for these point-in-time product contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer and customer acceptance; however, periodically, we transfer control of products in advance of billing or we receive customer advances and deposits from customers in advance of transfer of control of products which are recognized as contract assets or contract liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Any differences between the timing of our revenue recognition and customer billings (based on contractual terms) result in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. 
Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time 
We recognize revenue from the sale of certain service contracts, including preventative maintenance, corrective services, and extended warranties over time on a ratable basis consistent with the nature, timing, and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as-needed product repairs. Our billing terms for these contracts vary and can occur in advance of or following the period of service; however, we generally invoice periodically as services are provided. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized and customer billings (based on contractual terms) result in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.
 
See Note 3, Revenue Recognition for further information.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH. 
Cash deposits, short-term investments, and high-liquidity mutual funds with original maturities of three months or less are included in Cash
, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
. Restricted cash primarily relates to funds restricted in connection with escrow accounts and other contractual and legal restrictions. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, which was prior to the Spin-Off
, the cash presented in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows represents cash not subject to the GE centralized cash management process. Cash held in commingled accounts with GE, or its affiliates, is presented within Net parent investment in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Changes in Equity.
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES.
 
Publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. Privately held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative approach and are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, with changes in the measurement recognized through Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
176
 million and $
156
 million, respectively. Investment securities are recognized within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. 
Equity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. Equity method investments are recognized within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
 
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information.
RECEIVABLES. 
Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of products and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowances for credit losses, chargebacks, and other credits. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables.
See Note 5
, 
Receivables

 for further information.
67
FINANCING RECEIVABLES. 
Our financing receivables portfolio consists of a variety of loans and leases, including both larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans and leases, and smaller-balance homogeneous loans and leases. 
Loans
 
Loans represent term loans that are collateralized by equipment and other assets. Loans are classified as either held for sale or held for investment (HFI) based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans where the Company does not have the ability and intent to hold for investment purposes and those where the Company intends to hold for sale in the foreseeable future are accounted for as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or current fair value with any fair value write-down (or change to the write-down) recorded as a valuation allowance through current period earnings in the period in which the change occurs. Loans classified as HFI are recorded at amortized cost. 
Investment in Finance Leases 
Finance leases include mostly sales-type leases of equipment and represent net unpaid rentals and estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment, less related deferred income and less the allowance for credit losses. 
See Note 7, Leases for further information on our finance leases and Allowance for credit losses below for the Companys policy regarding allowances for credit losses on financing receivables. 
Credit Quality Indicators 
We manage our financing receivables portfolio using delinquency and nonaccrual data as key performance indicators. We assess the overall quality of the portfolio based on a potential risk of loss measure. The metric incorporates both the borrowers credit quality along with any related collateral protection. Financing receivables are considered past due if default on a contractual principal or interest payment exists for a period of 30 days or more. We stop accruing interest on financing receivables at the earlier of when collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due. Although we stop accruing interest in advance of payments, we recognize income within Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income when we determine that the account is returned to accrual status, provided that the amount does not exceed that which would have been earned at the historical effective interest rate.
See 
Note 6, Financing Receivables
 for further information.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
. 
When we record customer receivables, contract assets, and financing receivables, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. The credit losses are recognized within Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. For financing receivables, expected credit losses are calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, multiplied by a factor reflecting the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. 
We routinely evaluate our entire portfolio for potential specific credit or collection issues that might indicate an impairment.
We estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information from past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.
INVENTORIES. 
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable values. Cost of inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Inventories are generally classified as current, however, based on consumption timelines, certain inventories are considered non-current and are recognized, net of related reserves, within All other non-current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
As necessary, we record provisions and write-downs for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to historical utilization and estimates of future product demand, market conditions, and technological developments.
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information. 
68
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT. 
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives generally range from 
8
 to 
40
 years for buildings, structures and related equipment, 
3
 to 
20
 years for machinery and equipment, and 
1
 to 
15
 years for leasehold improvements. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.
 
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information.
LEASES.
Lessee Arrangements
 
At lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset. ROU assets are recognized within Property, plant, and equipment  net and lease liabilities are recognized within All other current liabilities and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Options to extend a lease are included as part of the ROU lease asset and liability at commencement when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets except our vehicle leases. Non-lease components are generally related to services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset. As the Companys leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease commencement for leases that commenced post-Spin-Off and GEs incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease commencement for leases that commenced pre-Spin-Off. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, an ROU asset and lease liability are not recognized, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our leases include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on, but not limited to, maintenance, insurance, taxes, index escalations, and usage-based amounts. The Company recognizes variable lease payments not included in its lease liabilities in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. We review ROU assets for impairment annually or 
when events occur or circumstances change that 
indicate that the asset may be impaired.
Lessor Arrangements 
Equipment leased to others under operating leases is recognized within Property, plant, and equipment  net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Leases classified as sales-type leases or direct finance leases are recognized within All other current assets and All other non-current assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The terms of the related contracts, including the proportion of fixed versus variable payments and any options to shorten or extend the lease term or purchase the underlying asset, vary by customer.
See Note 6, Financing Receivables and Note 7, Leases for further information.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each year as of October 1
st
, or more frequently 
when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the reporting units carrying value and its fair value.
 When performing a quantitative test, the market approach is typically used for estimating the fair values for our reporting units. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Depending on the specific reporting unit circumstances, we may also consider performing a valuation based on an income approach. 
It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates used could change in future periods.
69
In-proce
ss research and development (IPR&D) acquired as part of a business acquisition is capitalized at fair value 
when acquired and is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year or when events occur or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. When testing IPR&D for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that the IPR&D is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the IPR&Ds carrying value and its fair value. When the IPR&D project is complete, the asset is considered a finite-lived intangible asset and subject to an impairment test at that date. Thereafter, the resulting asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and is subject to impairment assessments in the same manner as all amortizing intangible assets.
For other intangible assets that are not deemed indefinite-lived, the cost of the intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. 
Internal-use software is software that is developed, purchased, or modified to meet internal needs and for which no substantive plan exists to sell, lease, or otherwise market the software externally. All costs associated with project tasks classified in the preliminary project development or post-implementation/operation stage are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of application development stage costs begins after both of the following occur: (1) the preliminary project development stage is completed and (2) management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the purpose for which it was intended. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete. Capitalized amounts are recognized within Other intangible assets  net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. 
External use software relates to software that is (1) intended to be sold, licensed, or marketed to our customers or (2) embedded and integral to our tangible products for which research and development (R&D) has been completed. Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of software are expensed as incurred. Costs that are incurred after technological feasibility has been established until general release of the product are capitalized as an intangible asset and recognized within Other intangible assets  net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Capitalized costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are amortized on an individual product basis using straight-line amortization over the estimated useful life of the product. The Company performs regular reviews to assess whether unamortized capitalized external use software program costs remain recoverable through future revenue.
 
See Note 8, Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. 
We use derivative contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices. Our policy is to 
use derivatives solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes. 
We employ the following hedge types: (1) cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk associated with third-party and intercompany foreign currency-denominated forecasted transactions and firm commitments, (2) net investment hedges of foreign currency risk associated with investments in foreign operations, (3) fair value hedges of interest rate risk associated with long-term borrowings, and (4) economic hedges not designated as qualifying hedging relationships of foreign currency risk associated with monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances, equity price risk, and commodity price risk.
For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the components of the hedging derivatives excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred and amortized to earnings in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the derivative transaction.
Contracts that do not in their entirety meet the definition of a derivative instrument and are not measured at fair value may contain embedded features affecting some or all of the cash flows or value of other exchanges that would otherwise be considered derivatives when assessed separately from the host contract. Such embedded features are separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative measured at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract.

INCOME TAXES.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, which was prior to the Spin-Off, the Companys income tax provision was determined using the separate return method. As a result, actual amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of GE related to the Company may differ from the amounts included in our financial statements. For post Spin-Off periods we file tax returns on our own behalf, and our deferred taxes and actual income tax rate may differ from those in the historical pre Spin-Off periods.
Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are included in the financial statements. Such uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that the Company believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Our policy is to adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the change in the technical merit of a position, an uncertain tax position is effectively settled with the relevant taxing authority, or the statute of limitations has expired. Penalties and interest related to income tax matters are recognized within Benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income. 
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred income tax balances are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when those taxes are paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits considering all available positive and negative evidence, including the impact of the Tax Matters Agreement with GE, specifically assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, if applicable, and available tax planning strategies. To the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established to reduce its carrying value to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred taxes are provided for the outside basis difference of certain investments in non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies based upon our evaluation of the undistributed earnings of such entities if the permanently reinvested assumption cannot be made.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. 
Prior to the Spin-Off, GE sponsored plans were accounted for as multiemployer plans. Therefore, the Combined Statement of Income reflects a proportionate allocation of net periodic benefit costs for the multiemployer plans associated with the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In connection with the Spin-Off, on January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare assumed a portion of former GE pension and other postretirement obligations and assets. The pension and other postretirement obligations assumed relate to benefits owed to current GE HealthCare employees, former GE HealthCare employees, and certain GE legacy plan participants. As of January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare established the assumed pension plans as single-employer plans, but continued to participate in legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans sponsored by GE. 
On January 1, 2024, we transitioned from the legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans to a GE HealthCare sponsored single-employer postretirement benefit plan. This change did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.
 
Management accounts for the pension and postretirement plans as defined benefit plans. 
We measure our plan assets at fair value and categorize plan assets for disclosure purposes in accordance with the fair value hierarchy
. Certain assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The components of net periodic benefit costs, other than the service cost component, are recognized within Non-operating benefit (income) costs in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income for plans sponsored by the Company.
We engage third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of benefit obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. We develop significant long-term assumptions, including discount rates and the expected rate of return on assets in connection with our pension accounting. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement, we recognize differences between expected long-term return on plan assets and actual returns, and net actuarial gains and losses for the pension plan liabilities within the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
We amortize gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions, that exceed 10% of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or benefit obligations, determined as of the beginning of the year. The period over which gains and losses are amortized to earnings is generally over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.
 
See Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans for further information.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES. 
Loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, product warranties, claims, litigation, environmental obligations, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality, and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the loss. When there appears to be a range of possible losses with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable and an estimate can be made, when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
See 
Note 14
, 
Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies
 for further information. 
SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMS. 
The Company participates in voluntary supply chain finance programs which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their GE HealthCare receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure the use of a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables does not change the nature, existence, amount, or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any characteristics of the trade payables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables to borrowings. 
In connection with the supply chain finance programs, payment terms normally range from 
30
 to 
180
 days, depending on the underlying supplier agreements.
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information. 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. 
The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments at fair value including certain assets within our postretirement benefit plans. Observable inputs for fair value measurements reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1  Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 

Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

Level 3  Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. 
See 
Note 13
, 
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
 for further information.
RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. 
For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily money market funds, investment securities, derivatives, and contingent consideration, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. 
Money Market Funds
Money market funds are valued using pricing information from the fund managers, quoted on a daily basis, and are considered Level 2 inputs.
Investment Securities
Publicly traded equity securities are valued using Level 1 quoted price inputs.
72
Derivatives
 
The majority of our derivatives are valued using model-derived offers received from financial institutions for similar over-the-counter instruments without an active market or internal models. The models maximize observable inputs including interest rates and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, foreign currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity exchange contracts, embedded derivatives, and the equity-linked total return swap were valued using Level 2 inputs.
Contingent Consideration
When an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we record on the date of acquisition a liability for the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future. The fair value is based upon estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios using a probability-weighted expected payment model discounted to present value. The estimates used to determine the fair value are subject to significant judgment and as such are considered Level 3 inputs. We subsequently remeasure such liabilities at the end of each reporting period and record changes in the fair value within SG&A in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
Investments in Private Equity, Real Estate and Collective Funds held within our Postretirement Benefit Plans
Most investments are generally valued using the NAV per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. Investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments classified within Level 3 primarily relate to real estate and private equities which are valued using unobservable inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans for further information.
Debt Securities held within our Postretirement Benefit Plans
When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are Level 1 inputs. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendors models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. These investments are classified within Level 2. See Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans for further information.
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 13, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further information.
NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. 
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 
These items may include financing receivables and long-lived assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale and impaired equity method investments and long-lived assets, which, when written down to fair value upon an impairment, are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. 
The following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure these assets not measured on a recurring fair value basis.
Equity Method Investments
 
Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and are adjusted in each period for the Companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid. 
In instances of impairment, equity method investments are written down to fair value using market observable data such as quoted prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches, as appropriate. These investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.
Equity Investments
 Without Readily Determinable Fair Value
 
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value, subject to a policy choice on a transaction-by-transaction basis, are accounted for under the measurement alternative at cost less impairment and adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in or
derly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. In the instance of impairment, if any, equity investments are adjusted to fair value using market observable data if available. If market observable data is not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow models, comparative market multiples, or a combination of these approaches using Level 3 inputs.
Financing Receivables
 
We generally use market data, including pricing on recently closed market transactions, to value financing receivables that are held for sale. Such financing receivables are valued using Level 2 inputs. When the data is unobservable, we use valuation methodologies based on current market interest rate data adjusted for inherent credit risk. Such financing receivables are valued using Level 3 inputs. 
Long-Lived Assets
Fair values of long-lived assets are primarily developed internally and are corroborated by available external appraisal information, as applicable. 
These assets are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.
73
FOREIGN CURRENCY. 
We have determined that the functional currency for many of our international operations is the local currency, and for other international operations the functional currency is the USD. The basis of this determination is the currency in which each of the international operations primarily generates and expends cash. When the functional currency is not the USD, asset and liability accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates. The Company translates functional currency income and expense amounts to their USD equivalents using average exchange rates for the period. These translation gains and losses are recognized within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  net (AOCI) in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of monetary items in the non-functional currency and those resulting from remeasurements of monetary items, are included in Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and R&D in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income, depending on the underlying nature of the item.
 Net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions were $
16
 million, $
16
 million, and $(
88
) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. 
Our financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. When we acquire the remaining equity ownership of a company in which we hold an equity interest, we remeasure our equity interest to fair value. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as Goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. For those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, on the date of acquisition we record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future.
 
See Note 8, Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets and Note 13, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further information. 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. 
Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or are spun-off. Presentation as discontinued operations is consistent for all periods presented.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS. 
We record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. Employee termination costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.
 
See Note 15, Restructuring Activities for further information.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. 
The Company conducts R&D activities to create new products, develop new applications for existing products, and enhance existing products. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. 
In certain instances, R&D activities may be funded by third parties, including government entities. These R&D funding arrangements may include upfront payments, R&D cost sharing payments, and future milestone payments that may be based upon the occurrence of future R&D or commercialization events. Payments received as part of the R&D funding arrangements are generally presented as an offset to R&D expense.
 
COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS.
We enter into collaborative arrangements primarily related to development of new products. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves two or more parties who are active participants in the activity, and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. The assessment for a collaborative arrangement is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties. Amounts that are owed by collaboration partners related to R&D activities are generally presented as an offset to R&D expense.
 
See Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information. 
74
ACCOUNTING CHANGES.
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, provides that interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits may either be classified as income tax expense or interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its accounting policy for presentation of interest expense on uncertain tax positions. The interest wa
s previously presented within Interest and other financial charges  net and has changed to being presented within Benefit (provision) for income taxes. The Company believes this presentation is preferable because the cost is related to income tax matters and this presentation enhances comparability with our peers. The effects of the change in accounting have been prospectively applied to periods beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and were not material to any previously reported periods prior to March 31, 2023. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Reflected in These Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07 (ASU 2023-07), 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. ASU 2023-07 requires annual and interim disclosures that are expected to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The provisions of ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended December 31, 2024, retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. See Note 4, Segment and Geographical Information for further information.
Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 (ASU 2023-09), 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. ASU 2023-09 addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on the disclosures in our notes to the financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 (ASU 2024-03), 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. ASU 2024-03 addresses investor requests for more transparency about expense information through the disaggregation of relevant expense captions in the notes to the financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2024-03 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We expect the adoption to impact disclosures in our notes to the financial statements.
NOTE 3. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
CONTRACT AND OTHER DEFERRED ASSETS.
Contract assets reflect revenue recognized on contracts with customers in excess of billings based on contractual terms. Contract assets are classified as current or non-current based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the Companys right to consideration becomes unconditional. Other deferred assets consist of costs to obtain contracts, primarily commissions, other cost deferrals for shipped products, and deferred service, labor, and direct overhead costs.

two years
 of being capitalized. When recognized, the costs to obtain a contract are recorded within SG&A in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
75
CONTRACT LIABILITIES.
Contract liabilities include customer advances and deposits received when orders are placed and billed in advance of completion of performance obligations. Contract liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the periods over which these remaining performance obligations are expected to be satisfied with our customers.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, contract liabilities were approximately $
2,629
 million and $
2,623
 million, respectively, of which the non-current portion of $
686
 million and $
705
 million, respectively, was recognized in All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Revenue recognized related to the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the year was approximately $
1,585
 million and $
1,554
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.
Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represents the estimated revenue expected from customer contracts that are partially or fully unperformed inclusive of amounts deferred in contract liabilities, excluding contracts, or portions thereof, that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty.

NOTE 4. 
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
Effective July 1, 2024, Image Guided Therapies, previously part of the Imaging segment, was realigned to the Ultrasound segment. The Ultrasound segment was subsequently renamed Advanced Visualization Solutions. Following this realignment, the Company continues to have 
four
 reportable segments: Imaging, AVS, PCS, and PDx. Historical segment financial information presented within this report has been recast to conform to the new reportable segments structure.
The Companys organizational structure is based upon the availability of separate financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. The Companys CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products sold and how the Company manages its operations. We have not aggregated any of our operating segments to form reportable segments. A description of our reportable segments has been provided in Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The CODM assesses segment performance using Total revenues and an earnings metric defined as Segment EBIT. Segment EBIT is calculated as income before income taxes in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income excluding the impact of the following: Interest and other financial charges  net, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, Spin-Off and separation costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and investment revaluation gain (loss). Segment EBIT is also used in the annual budget and periodic forecasting processes and informs the CODM in decision making regarding the allocation of resources to the segments.

ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
PROPOSED ACQUISITION.
On December 1, 2024, we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining stake in the Nihon Medi-Physics Co., Ltd (NMP) equity method investment to assume full ownership. NMP is a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer in Japan, focused on radiopharmaceuticals, which are used to enable clinical images across neurology, cardiology, and oncology procedures, as well as nonclinical and clinical development of radiotracers and theranostics research. Their product portfolio includes several GE HealthCare radiopharmaceuticals. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.
ACQUISITIONS.
MIM Software
On April 1, 2024, the Company acquired 
100
% of the stock of MIM Software Inc. (MIM Software) for approximately $
259
 million, net of cash acquired of $
11
 million, and potential contingent payments valued at $
13
 million pertaining to achievement of certain milestones, for a total preliminary purchase price of $
283
 million. The acquisition included up to $
23
 million of other contingent payments based on service requirements. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $
194
 million, customer-related intangible assets of $
52
 million, developed technology intangible assets of $
48
 million, net deferred tax liabilities of $
18
 million, and other net assets of $
7
 million. Purchase price allocations are based on preliminary valuations. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The goodwill associated with the acquired business, recorded within the Imaging segment, is non-deductible for tax purposes and is attributed to expected synergies and commercial benefits from use of the MIM Software technology in our existing GE HealthCare portfolio. MIM Software is a global provider of medical imaging analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for the practice of radiation oncology, molecular radiotherapy, diagnostic imaging, and urology at imaging centers, hospitals, specialty clinics, and research organizations worldwide. 
81
Revenue and earnings of MIM Software included in the Companys financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to our consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of MIM Software had taken place as of the beginning of 2023, consolidated revenues and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.
Caption Health
On February 17, 2023, the Company acquired 
100
% of the stock of Caption Health, Inc. (Caption Health) for $
127
 million of upfront payment, $
10
 million of future holdback payment, and potential earn-out payments valued at $
13
 million based primarily on various milestones and sales targets. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $
94
 million, intangible assets of $
60
 million, and deferred tax liabilities of $
3
 million. The purchase price allocation for Caption Health was finalized in the first quarter of 2024 without material adjustments. The goodwill associated with the acquired business is non-deductible for tax purposes and is reported in the AVS segment. Caption Health is an AI company whose technology expands access to AI-guided ultrasound screening for novice users.
GOODWILL.
As discussed in Note 4, Segment and Geographical Information, effective in the third quarter of 2024, the Company (1) reorganized its operations and moved responsibility for and reporting of IGT from the Imaging segment to the Ultrasound Segment and (2) renamed the Ultrasound segment the AVS segment. This resulted in a $
1,031
 million increase in the Companys allocation of goodwill to its AVS segment and a corresponding decrease in the goodwill allocated to the Imaging segment. 
The Company allocated goodwill to its new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In connection with this change in reportable segments in the third quarter of 2024, the Company evaluated the goodwill of our Imaging and AVS reporting units for impairment before and after the segment realignment. There were 
no
 impairments identified as part of these assessments.

The Company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter. In 2024, the Company performed quantitative testing for all reporting units that carried goodwill. The quantitative testing conducted concluded that 
no
 goodwill impairments existed. In 2023, a qualitative assessment was performed. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no quantitative testing was required.

NOTE 9. 
BORROWINGS
The Companys borrowings include the following senior unsecured notes and credit agreements:
Senior Unsecured Notes
The Companys borrowings include $
8,250
 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in 
six
 series with maturity dates ranging from 2025 through 2052 (collectively, the Notes). This reflects the $
1,000
 million aggregate principal amount of 
4.800
% senior unsecured notes issued by the Company in the third quarter of 2024, and a repayment in the fourth quarter of 2024 of $
1,000
 million aggregate principal amount of 
5.550
% senior unsecured notes.
Interest payments on the Notes are due semi-annually until maturity. In the event of a change in control and a related downgrade of the ratings of the Notes below investment grade, the indenture governing the Notes requires that the Company make an offer to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part of that holders notes at a repurchase price equal to 
101
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture also includes a limitation on liens incurred by the Company and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. The indenture does not restrict the Company or its subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness, nor does it contain any financial covenants. All covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications. Refer to the table below for further information about the Notes.
Credit Facilities
The Company has credit agreements providing for:

a 
five-year
 senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $
2,500
 million, maturing on January 3, 2028; 

a 
364-day
 senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $
1,000
 million, maturing on December 10, 2025; and

a 
three-year
 senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
2,000
 million, maturing on January 2, 2026 (the Term Loan Facility and, together with the 
five-year
 revolving credit facility and the 
364-day
 revolving credit facility, the Credit Facilities).
There were 
no
 outstanding amounts under the 
five-year
 revolving credit facility and 
364-day
 revolving credit facility, and there was $
750
 million and $
1,150
 million outstanding on the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the first and fourth quarters of 2024, we repaid $
150
 million and $
250
 million, respectively, of the Term Loan Facility. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into a new 
364-day
 senior unsecured revolving credit facility to replace the 
364-day
 senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matured in December 2024.
The Company pays a facility fee to each lender, which accrues at a rate equal to an applicable margin specified in the revolving credit facility agreements on the daily commitments of the lenders. The borrowings under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable interest rates equal to: (1) the alternate base rate or (2) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin specified in the credit agreement. The Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants customary to financings of this type that limit, among other things, the Companys ability to incur additional liens and to enter into certain fundamental change transactions and the incurrence of indebtedness by the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant that requires the Company to not exceed a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at each reporting period during 2024. The Credit Facilities will be used for general corporate purposes.

LETTERS OF CREDIT, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had bank guarantees and surety bonds of approximately $
784
 million and $
751
 million, respectively, related to certain commercial contracts. Additionally, we have issued approximately $
25
 million and $
39
 million of guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to residual value and credit guarantees on equipment sold to third-party finance companies. Our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflect a liability of $
3
 million and $
4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these guarantees. For credit-related guarantees, we estimate our expected credit losses related to off-balance sheet credit exposure consistent with the method used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. See Note 14, Commitments, Guarantees, Product Warranties, and Other Loss Contingencies for further information on guarantee arrangements with GE.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS SPONSORED BY GE PRIOR TO SPIN-OFF. 
C
ertain GE HealthCare employees were covered under various pension and other postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans sponsored by GE prior to the Spin-Off. These plans were accounted for as multiemployer plans prior to the Spin-Off. Certain 
of these benefit plans are closed to new participants. For the year ended December 31, 2022, relevant costs for these plans were allocated to the Company by GE and recognized within the Combined Statements of Income. These costs included service costs for active employees in the U.S. GE Pension Plan, certain international pension plans, the U.S. GE Supplementary Pension Plan, and certain U.S. retiree benefit plans. 
Expenses associated with our employees participation in the U.S. GE Pension Plan and certain U.S. retiree benefit plans, which represent the majority of related expense, were $
73
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Expenses associated with our employees participation in certain international pension plans were $
11
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS POST SPIN-OFF. 
In connection with the Spin-Off, on January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare assumed a portion of former GE pension and other postretirement obligations and assets. The pension and other postretirement obligations assumed relate to benefits owed to current GE HealthCare employees, former GE HealthCare employees, and certain GE legacy plan participants. As of January 1, 2023, GE HealthCare established the assumed pension plans as single-employer plans, but continued to participate in legacy GE multiple-employer postretirement benefit plans sponsored by GE.
 On January 1, 2024, we transitioned from the legacy GE multiple-employer other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans to a GE HealthCare sponsored single-employer OPEB plan. This change did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.
The total assets and liabilities for all plans assumed by GE HealthCare on January 1, 2023, are shown in the tables below.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR PLANS.
As a result of the liabilities and assets transferred to GE HealthCare on January 1, 2023, we disclose in the following tables postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $
50
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we disclose postretirement plans with assets or obligations that exceed $
20
 million in the following tables. We use a December 31st measurement date for these plans and all tables presented below are for the years ended December 31st.
The U.S. Pension Plans are comprised of the obligations transferred to GE HealthCare from GE in connection with the Spin-Off and obligations that existed prior to the Spin-Off. The largest plans include the GE HealthCare Pension Plan and the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan, which provides supplementary benefits to higher-level, longer-service U.S. employees. The GE HealthCare Pension Plan and the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan have been closed to new participants since 2012. All remaining service accruals for the GE HealthCare Pension Plan were frozen effective December 31, 2024. Benefits for participants of the GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension Plan who became executives before 2011 were frozen effective January 1, 2021, and thereafter these employees accrue a benefit which is paid out in 
ten
 annual installments upon retirement. The GE HealthCare Pension Plan has a projected benefit obligation of $
15,230
 million, plan assets of $
13,650
 million, and is 
90
% funded per U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2024. The GE HealthCare Supplemental Pension plan has a projected benefit obligation of $
1,886
 million as of December 31, 2024, and the benefits are paid to eligible participants directly by the Company as described further in Funding below. 
Our International Pension Plans include all other plans that cover non-U.S. participants. These plans include obligations that existed prior to the Spin-Off and obligations transferred to GE HealthCare from GE in connection with the Spin-Off. In certain countries, benefit accruals have ceased and/or have been closed to new hires as of various dates.
The OPEB Plans include unfunded postretirement health and life insurance defined benefit obligations to U.S. participants. GE HealthCare assumed the obligations associated with these plans in connection with the Spin-Off. Participants share in the cost of the healthcare and life insurance benefits. With the exception of production employees, subsidized benefits are generally only available to closed groups of employees and retirees.
Funding
The Company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount for our qualified plans. Non-qualified plans are unfunded and we pay benefits from our cash on hand. In 2025, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $
327
 million to these plans.

Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions (such as changes in the discount rate and revised mortality rates). Actuarial gains in 2024 and losses in 2023 related to projected benefit obligations were primarily the result of changes in discount rates.

The projected benefit obligation (PBO) balance at December 31 represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of the measurement date and incorporates assumptions relating to future compensation levels and other demographic and financial assumptions. The accumulated benefit obligation represents the same actuarial obligations, excluding an assumption about future compensation levels.

In the third quarter of 2023, management approved an amendment to the U.S. based GE HealthCare Pension Plan whereby the benefits for all remaining active employees were frozen effective December 31, 2024, and additional benefit enhancements were provided. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax curtailment loss of approximately $
17
 million as non-operating benefit costs and an increase to our pension liability of $
23
 million in 2023. As a result of the plan changes, we remeasured the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. These changes collectively decreased AOCI by $
305
 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
87
In the fourth quarter of 2023, management approved and paid a one-time lump sum payment for certain terminated employees in 
two
 plans who were vested in their benefits. These lump sum settlements reduce our future cash requirements. As a result of the partial settlement of the pension liability, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge in 2023. The settlement charge of $
61
 million represents a pro rata portion of unrecognized net loss recorded in AOCI and is recorded in Non-operating benefit (income) costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

For the December 31, 2024 postretirement health care obligations remeasurement, the Company assumed a 
8.0
% initial weighted average rate of increase in the per capita cost of the various covered health care benefits, which applies primarily to non-Medicare eligible participants. The trend rate was assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 
4.5
% in 2036 and remain at that level thereafter.
Assumptions Used in Calculations 
Accounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement, and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in todays U.S. dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments are expected to be made. We also assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.
GE HealthCare engages third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of the pension and other postretirement defined benefit plan assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions, such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover, and update them as necessary to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future.
We determine the discount rate using the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities that have maturities consistent with the expected timing of benefit payments. 
The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future.
The compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which compensation of active plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and amortized to earnings in subsequent periods.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS.
The GE HealthCare Employee Benefits Investment Committee (the Investment Committee) and various country pension boards oversee and monitor the investment decisions related to the assets of our U.S. funded pension plans and other international pension assets, respectively. The Investment Committee retains independent investment managers and advisors and uses documented policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, the funded status of the plans, and other relevant factors and considerations.
The assets of our U.S. funded pension plans are invested in a portfolio that includes U.S. and international equity securities; U.S. government and corporate debt securities; asset-backed debt securities; private equity; real estate and other alternative investments; as well as cash and cash equivalents and derivatives contracts. This combination of assets and derivatives is utilized to implement the investment strategies as well as for hedging asset and liability risks. The Investment Committee sets target allocation percentages at an asset class level, including permitted ranges above or below the target allocation percentages.
The plan assets for international plans are managed and allocated by the country pension boards in each country.
The following tables summarize our pension plan assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There are no plan assets associated with our OPEB Plans. The inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets are consistent with the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN.
As a result of the Spin-Off, GE HealthCare established a defined contribution plan for its eligible U.S. employees that was largely consistent with the plan they participated in while GE HealthCare operated as a business of GE. Expenses associated with our employees participation in GE HealthCares defined contribution plan in 2024 and 2023 and GEs defined contribution plan allocated to the Company in 2022 represent the employer matching contributions for GE HealthCare employees and
 were $
130
 million, $
122
 million, and $
123
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
 
NOTE 11. 
INCOME TAXES
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. (both federal and state) and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the tax laws or regulations in these jurisdictions, or in positions by the relevant authorities regarding their application, administration, or interpretation, may affect our tax liability, return on investments, and business operations.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes tax on the Company for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have elected to account for GILTI as a period cost.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. 
The Company is subject to periodic tax audits by tax authorities in the U.S. (both federal and state) and the numerous countries in which we operate. While the Company currently is being audited, or remains subject to audit, in a number of jurisdictions for tax years 2004-2023, including
 China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States
, we believe that there are no jurisdictions in which the ultimate outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for all unrecognized tax benefits.
The balance of unrecognized tax benefits, the amount of related interest and penalties, and what we believe to be the range of reasonably possible changes in the next 12 months are as follows.

In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its accounting policy for presentation of interest expense on uncertain tax positions from within Interest and other financial charges  net to within Benefit (provision) for income taxes. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
13
 million and $
12
 million, respectively, of interest expense on uncertain tax positions was recorded in Benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $
12
 million of interest expense on uncertain tax positions was recorded in Interest and other financial charges  net in the Combined Statement of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
4
 million and $
6
 million, respectively, of income tax penalties were recorded in Benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
No
 accrual for penalties was made in the year ended December 31, 2022.
DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. 
We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized (a likelihood of more than 50%). Significant judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and the amount of such valuation allowance. In assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024, we considered all available evidence, including the nature of financial statement losses, reversing taxable temporary differences, estimated future operating profits, and tax planning actions and strategies.

The deferred tax asset associated with capitalized R&D is related to U.S. tax law that requires capitalization and amortization over five or fifteen years. In the event the capitalization of research costs is adjusted through retroactive legislation effective for 2022, the Company expects to record a reduction to the 2022 deferred tax asset resulting in a charge to tax expense under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE in the amount of $
228
 million.
In connection with the Spin-Off, our net deferred income tax assets inc
reased in 2023 by $
3,099
 million primarily due to transfers from GE, including $
964
 million related to pension and postretirement benefits, with the remainder primarily attributable to tax attributes that were not part of the Companys stand-alone operations, and changes to valuation on a GE HealthCare basis.
Valuation allowances primarily relate to non-U.S. deferred taxes where there were historical losses and U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards. 
Activity in the valuation allowance consists of the following:

As a result of the Spin-Off, there was an increase in the valuation allowance of $
269
 million in 2023, which is included in the Foreign currency exchange and other line of the table above. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our valuation allowance decreased by $
310
 million, which included a release of a valuation allowance in France of $
295
 million reflected in the Provision for income taxes line. Based on our analysis of all positive and negative evidence during the year ended December 31, 2024, we concluded that it is more likely than not that France deferred tax assets will be realizable based on our profitability in France as a stand-alone company post Spin-Off and our expectation for the continued generation of prospective positive income in the jurisdiction. In making these judgments, we considered various business and structural factors as a stand-alone company, which support our conclusion of the realization of the deferred tax assets.
92
NET OPERATING LOSSES.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $
5,978
 million primarily related to France, Ireland, Brazil, Germany, and the Netherlands, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The gross net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a deferred tax asset of $
1,133
 million as of December 31, 2024. This amount excludes accruals of $
266
 million for unrecognized tax benefits the Company has recorded related to the underlying tax positions which generated the net operating losses and expected impacts to U.S. foreign tax credits of $
420
 million. 
UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS.
 
Post Spin-Off, the Companys previously undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are no longer indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. businesses due to current U.S. funding needs. Therefore, in 2023, an incremental deferred tax liability of $
21
 million was recorded for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of earnings. In addition, the Company is providing for withholding and other foreign taxes due upon future distribution of current period earnings. However, the Company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon an unforeseen future reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution or disposition to an unrelated third party) of approximately $
8
 billion to be permanent in duration. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable.

NOTE 13. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.
Our primary objective in executing and holding derivative contracts is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices. These derivative contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the aforementioned risks. Our policy is to use derivative contracts solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes.
The fair values of derivative contracts are recognized within All other current assets, All other non-current assets, All other current liabilities, and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the contractual timing of settlements for these contracts. We designate certain derivative contracts as hedging instruments in cash flow, fair value, or net investment hedges. We evaluate the effectiveness of our derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments on a quarterly basis.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the volatility of cash flows related to firm commitments and forecasted transactions, including intercompany transactions, denominated in foreign currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency. The maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is 
two years
. As of December 31, 2024, these contracts have a maximum remaining maturity of 
15
 months.
For derivative instruments designated as cash
 
flow hedges, changes in the fair value of designated hedging instruments are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and to the same financial statement line item impacted by the hedged transaction. As of December 31, 2024, we expect to reclassify $
22
 million of pre-tax net deferred gain associated with designated cash flow hedges to earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the impact on earnings of the related hedged transactions.
The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in All other operating activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.
Net Investment Hedges
We use cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts in combination with foreign currency option contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2024, these contracts were designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily in Euro and Chinese Renminbi currencies.
We use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency to USD spot exchange rates are initially recorded and held as a component of the CTA portion of AOCI until the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated. Changes in fair value of the portion of net investment hedging derivatives excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in CTA and then recognized within Interest and other financial charges  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedge. Excluded components on the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges, in the form of accrued interest, are recorded within Interest and other financial charges  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded in All other investing activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2024, All other investing activities  net includes a $
94
 million payment for the settlement of cross-currency swaps that were designated in net investment hedges. Cash flows from the periodic interest settlements on the cross-currency swaps are recorded in All other operating activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.
Fair Value Hedges
We use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on our fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rate risk of specific designated cash flows of our senior unsecured notes. In the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2024, we executed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional of $
700
 million and $
1,000
 million, respectively, to hedge the benchmark interest rate risk of specific designated cash flows of a senior unsecured note.
We record the changes in fair value on these swap contracts in Interest and other financial charges  net in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income, the same line item where the offsetting change in the fair value of the designated cash flows of the senior unsecured note is recorded as a basis adjustment.
Cash flows for the periodic interest settlements on the interest rate swaps are recorded in All other operating activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.
94
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instrument
s
We also execute derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts and equity-linked total return swaps, which are not designated as qualifying hedges. These derivatives serve as economic hedges of foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risks. We also identify and record foreign currency-related features in our purchase or sales contracts where the currency is not the local or functional currency of any substantive party to the contract and record them as embedded derivatives.
The changes in fair value of derivatives not designated in qualifying hedge transactions are recorded in Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income based on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. Changes in fair value of embedded derivatives are recognized in Other (income) expense  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
The cash flows associated with derivatives not designated but used as economic hedges are recorded, based on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, in All other operating activities  net and All other investing activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows. The cash flows related to embedded derivatives are included in All other operating activities  net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

Under the master arrangements with the respective counterparties to our derivative contracts, in certain circumstances and subject to applicable requirements, we are allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and in the table above. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the potential effect of rights of offset associated with the derivative contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities by $
77
 million and $
41
 million, respectively.

Counterparty Credit Risk
The Company would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts as of the reporting date. The fair value of the Companys derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements, and changes in our positions.
We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties, and by actively monitoring counterparty credit ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure. 
We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. None of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.

Cash equivalents
As of December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $
2,889
 million and $
2,504
 million, respectively, included money market funds of $
312
 million and $
200
 million, and other cash equivalents of $
1,573
 million and $
1,023
 million, respectively. The carrying values of the other cash equivalents approximates the fair value due to their short maturities and are valued using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. Refer to Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information.
97
Derivatives
Derivatives are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow method or option models using interest rates, foreign exchange spot and forward rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads as key inputs. Unobservable inputs relate to our own credit risk which is not significant to the overall measurement of fair value.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value based on estimates of future cash flows in connection with business acquisitions
. As the valuation of these liabilities is based on inputs that are less observable or not observable in the market, the determination of fair value is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Non-recurring fair value measurements
Changes in fair value measurements of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as equity method investments, equity investments without readily determinable fair value, financing receivables, and long-lived assets, were not material for the 
years ended
 December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Fair value of other financial instruments
The estimated fair value of borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
9,374
 million and $
9,959
 million, respectively, compared to a carrying value (which only includes a reduction for unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts and cumulative basis adjustment) of $
8,951
 million and $
9,442
 million, respectively. The fair value of our borrowings includes accrued interest and is determined based on observable and quoted prices and spreads of comparable debt and benchmark securities and is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9, Borrowings and Note 18, Supplemental Financial Information for further information.
NOTE 14. 
COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, AND OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES 
GUARANTEES. 
The Company has off-balance sheet credit exposure through standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, bid bonds, and surety bonds. See Note 9, Borrowings for further information. 
Following the Spin-Off, which was completed pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company had remaining performance guarantees on behalf of GE. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, GE was obligated to use reasonable best efforts to replace the Company as the guarantor or terminate all such performance guarantees. Until such termination or replacement, in the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the relevant obligors, the Company could have been obligated to make payments under the applicable instruments for which GE was obligated to reimburse and indemnify the Company. As of December 31, 2023, the Companys maximum aggregate exposure, subject to GE reimbursement, was approximately $
114
 million. In the second quarter of 2024, these remaining performance guarantees were all terminated or replaced.
PRODUCT WARRANTIES.
We provide warranty coverage to our customers as part of customary practices in the market to provide assurance that the products we sell comply with agreed-upon specifications. We provide estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Warranty accruals are estimates that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, therefore claims costs may differ from amounts provided.

LEGAL MATTERS. 
In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations; class actions; commercial, intellectual property, and product liability litigation; government investigations; investigations by competition/antitrust authorities; and other legal, regulatory, or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other parties, and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For such matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In 2017, a number of U.S. Service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the District Court) against a number of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including GE HealthCare and certain affiliates, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint seeks monetary relief and alleges that the defendants provided funding for an Iraqi terrorist organization through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims. In January 2022, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Courts decision. In February 2022, the defendants requested review of the decision by all of the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the D.C. Circuit). In February 2023, the D.C. Circuit denied this request. In June 2023, defendants petitioned the Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuits decision. On June 24, 2024, the Supreme Court vacated the D.C. Circuits decision and remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit for further consideration. On November 19, 2024, the D.C. Circuit heard oral argument from the parties, and the D.C. Circuits decision is pending. The proceedings in the District Court are currently inactive.
Government Disclosures 
From time to time, we make self-disclosures regarding our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws to relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us. We, with the assistance of outside counsel, made voluntary self-disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) beginning in 2018 regarding tender irregularities and other potential violations of the FCPA relating to our activities in certain provinces in China. We have been engaged in ongoing discussions with each of the SEC and the DOJ regarding these matters. We are fully cooperating with the reviews by these agencies and have implemented, and continue to implement, enhancements to our compliance policies and practices. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope, result, or related costs associated with these disclosures to the SEC and the DOJ. We also are unable to predict what, if any, action may be taken by the SEC or the DOJ or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, including applicable foreign laws, could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.
Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities. Liabilities for environmental remediation and nuclear decommissioning exclude possible insurance recoveries. Due to uncertainties or changes regarding the status of laws, regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, it is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued, and amounts not currently reasonably estimable and/or probable may need to be accrued in future periods. Our environmental remediation liabilities, which are measured on an undiscounted basis, were $
16
 million and $
19
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recognized within All other current liabilities and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
We record asset retirement obligations, which primarily relate to nuclear decommissioning, associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the obligation is incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. The liability is measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs are generally capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the assets useful lives. Our asset retirement obligations were $
292
 million and $
267
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recognized within All other current liabilities and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
99
OTHER UNRECOGNIZED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. 
We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments which represent take-or-pay contracts as well as purchase orders for goods and services utilized in the normal course of business such as capital expenditures, inventory, and services under contracts.
As of December 31, 2024, we had the following purchase commitments that are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and the amounts below exclude open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year.

NOTE 15. 
RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Restructuring activities are essential to optimize the business operating model for GE HealthCare and mostly involve workforce reductions, organizational realignments, and revisions to our real estate footprint. Specifically, restructuring charges (gains) primarily include facility exit costs, employee-related termination benefits associated with workforce reductions, asset write-downs, and cease-use costs. For segment reporting, restructuring activities are not allocated. 
Net expenses for restructuring initiatives committed to by management through December 31, 2024 are included in the table below.

Cost of products, Cost of services, or SG&A, as appropriate, in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income.
Liabilities related to restructuring are recognized within Current compensation and benefits, All other current liabilities, Non-current compensation and benefits, and All other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

NOTE 16. 
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
We grant stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance share units (PSUs) to employees under the 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approves grants under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, we are authorized to issue up to approximately 
41
 million shares. We record compensation expense for awards expected to vest over the vesting period. We estimate forfeitures based on experience and adjust expense to reflect actual forfeitures. When options are exercised, RSUs vest, and PSUs are earned, we issue shares from authorized unissued common stock. 
100
Stock options provide employees the opportunity to purchase GE HealthCare shares in the future at the market price of our stock on the date the award is granted. The options become exercisable over the vesting period, typically becoming fully vested in 
three
 to three and a half years, and expire 
ten years
 from the grant date if not exercised. We value stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
RSUs provide an employee the right to shares of GE HealthCare stock when the restrictions lapse over the vesting period of 
three
 to three and a half years. Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into one share of GE HealthCare common stock. We value RSUs using the market price on the grant date.
PSUs provide an employee with the right to receive shares of GE HealthCare stock based upon achievement of certain performance metrics. PSUs are subject to an employee service period of 
three
 years. PSUs may include a relative total shareholder return (TSR) modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. We engage third-party valuation specialists to assist with the fair value estimate of the PSUs that include the TSR modifier using a Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of possible outcomes.
The following tables provide the weighted average fair value of options, RSUs, and PSUs granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related weighted average stock option valuation assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model.

For awards granted in 2023 and 2024, the expected volatility was derived from a peer groups blended historical and implied volatility as GE HealthCare does not have sufficient historical volatility based on the expected term of the underlying options. The expected term of the stock options was determined using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expected annualized dividend payment at the date of grant.

NOTE 17. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is Net income attributable to GE HealthCare common stockholders. The denominator of basic EPS is the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PSUs is reflected in the denominator for diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.
On January 3, 2023, there were approximately 
454
 million shares of GE HealthCare common stock outstanding, including the interest in our outstanding shares of common stock retained by GE following the Distribution. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022 was calculated using this same number of common shares outstanding since no GE HealthCare equity awards were outstanding as of the Distribution Date.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. 
In October 2023, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novo Nordisk (Novo) to pursue a collaboration on the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of an ultrasound therapy. Under the terms of this agreement, in return for providing development activities associated with the development of the underlying ultrasound device to deliver Novos clinical therapies, we received an upfront nonrefundable payment with the potential for additional nonrefundable payments through 2027. We recognize the nonrefundable payments as an offset to R&D expense as we perform activities contemplated under this agreement. These nonrefundable payments are not material. We may also receive future payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones and regulatory approvals associated with the ultrasound therapy.
REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
.
The Company has noncontrolling interests with redemption features. These redemption features, such as put options, could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the occurrence of certain events. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position between liabilities and equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are initially recorded at the issuance date fair value. Those that are currently redeemable, or probable of becoming redeemable, are subsequently adjusted to the greater of current redemption value or initial carrying value. 
Activity attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is presented below.

As a result, these redeemable noncontrolling interests were remeasured to their current redemption value. The remeasurement was accounted for as a deemed preferred stock dividend of redeemable noncontrolling interest and recorded as an adjustment to Retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
(2) In the first quarter of 2023, the redeemable noncontrolling interest holder exercised its option redemption provision. The redemption amount of $

NOTE 19. 
RELATED PARTIES AND TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT
PRIOR TO SPIN-OFF.
Prior to the Spin-Off, GE provided the Company with significant corporate infrastructure and shared services. The following disclosures summarize related party activity between GE HealthCare and GE. This activity, which occurred prior to the Spin-Off, is included in the combined financial statements.
106
Pension, Benefit, and Contribution Plans
As discussed in Note 10, Postretirement Benefit Plans, employees of the Company participated in pension, benefit, and contribution plans that were sponsored by GE. The Company was charged $
207
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to employee participation in these plans. In connection with the Spin-Off, a portion of the plans were transferred to the Company.
Share-Based Compensation
GE granted various employee benefits to its group employees, including those of the Company, under the GE Long-Term Incentive Plan. These benefits primarily included stock options and RSUs. Compensation expense allocated to the Company was $
67
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and was primarily recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statement of Income. 
Corporate Overhead and Other Allocations from GE
GE provided certain services described below that were charged to the Company based on employee headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies.
For the year ended December 31
2022
Costs for centralized services
(1)
$
42
 
Costs associated with employee medical insurance
(2)
122
 
Costs for corporate and shared services
(3)
457
 
(1) Costs for centralized services such as public relations, treasury and cash management, and other services were recognized within SG&A in the Combined Statement of Income.
(2) Costs associated with employee medical insurance were recognized within Cost of products, Cost of services, SG&A, and R&D in the Combined Statement of Income based on the employee population.
(3) Costs for corporate and shared services such as information technology, finance and other services were primarily recognized in SG&A and R&D in the Combined Statement of Income.
Management believes that the expense and cost allocations have been determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. The amounts that would have been incurred on a stand-alone basis could have materially differed from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more or fewer employees, or other factors.
AFTER SPIN-OFF.
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into or adopted several agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and GE. These agreements were structured in anticipation of GEs transaction to separate the GE Vernova business. Refer to Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation for additional information. The below agreements had activity during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Separation and Distribution Agreement 
 sets forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off, including the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities, and establishes certain rights and obligations between the Company and GE following the Distribution, including procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.

Transition Services Agreement 
 governs all matters relating to the provision of shared services between the Company and GE on a transitional basis. The services the Company receives include support for information technology, human resources, supply chain, finance, and facilities services, among others. Some of these costs were included in the allocations from GE prior to Spin-Off. The services generally commenced on the date of the Spin-Off and terminated in the 
24
 months following the Distribution Date depending upon the related transitional service. We incurred $
172
 million, n
et, and $
372
 million, net, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under this agreement. These amounts represent fees charged from GE and GE Vernova to the Company, the majority of which are related to information technology, and are net of fees charged from the Company to GE and GE Vernova for facilities and other shared services. 

Tax Matters Agreement 
 governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between the Company and GE with respect to all tax matters (excluding employee-related taxes covered under the Employee Matters Agreement), in addition to certain restrictions which generally prohibit us from taking or failing to take any action in the 
two-year
 period following the Distribution that would prevent the Distribution from qualifying as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including limitations on our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion of tax liability for which the Company will bear contractual responsibility, and the Company and GE will each agree to indemnify each other against any amounts for which such indemnified party is not responsible.
107
Current amounts due from and to GE under the various agreements are recognized within Due from related parties or Due to related parties, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Non-current amounts due from GE were $
99
 million and $
81
 million, and due to GE were $
34
 million and $
33
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were recognized within All other non-current assets and All other non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and relate to tax and other indemnities. Following its separation from GE, GE Vernova does not meet the definition of a related party; accordingly, amounts as of December 31, 2024 due to and from GE Vernova in accordance with the TSA are excluded from the Due from related parties and Due to related parties financial statement line items and non-current balances disclosed above.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, and that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that they were effective as of December 31, 2024. All internal control systems have inherent limitations; as such, they may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements preparation and reporting. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the current control structure may become inadequate for changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.
The effectiveness of such controls has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company continued to exit from various transition service agreements with GE, primarily related to IT systems that impact financial reporting. Consequently, responsibility for execution of related internal controls transferred to the Company, including general IT controls in connection with IT environment changes. Other than those discussed in the preceding sentences, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
